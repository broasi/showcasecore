This month's Warren Showcase Cover "Infatuation" is created by Michelle Czajkowski.
<br><br>
Michelle is 20 years old and has been studying art ever since 
she was young girl. Michelle has self-published a comic book and had 
the opportunity to intern at the McFarlane Toy Company in her 
hometown of Bloomingdale, New Jersey. 
<br><br>
After studying oil painting for 8 years at the Ridgewood Art 
Institute with her instructor Celeste Hoffman, she decided to teach herself 
digital painting; a type of illustration technique using Photoshop and a 
pen tablet. She enjoys digitally painting in her spare time and 
is currently working on another comic book project. 
<br><br>
When she is not painting she is brushing up on her computer 
animation skills in Maya, an animation program used to make 3D animated 
movies. 
<br><br>
Since graduating Butler High School in June of 2007, Michelle has 
been attending the School of Visual Arts in New York City. She is 
currently a sophomore and is majoring in Computer Art. Michelle hopes to one 
day become a skilled computer animator and work for the company 
Pixar.
