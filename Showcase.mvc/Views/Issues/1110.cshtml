Danielle Auriemma - D'Amico is the featured front cover artist for the Holiday Showcase and she has contributed her painting "Wreaths". Danielle works out of her home in Gillette, NJ. She is a member of the Contemporary Artist Group and the Millburn-Short Hills Art Center. 
Currently, Danielle is in a group showing at the Carole G. Simon Cancer Center in Morristown Memorial Hospital, running through mid January of 2011. Danielle just finished a group show at Overlook Hospital. One of her paintings was also featured at the Papermill Playhouse and she has exhibited in New York City, Baltimore as well as throughout New Jersey.  Danielle received a bronze medal on Portfolios.com and her illustration work has been published nationally as well.
<br><br>
Danielle considers all of her paintings to be portraiture.
<br><br>
They say, "take time to stop and smell the roses."  "While viewing my work, you may notice that many of my paintings capture the visual essence of this invitation. Indeed, there is an importance in seeing "the big picture" in life; however, first one must dissect the pieces."
<br><br>
"What's interesting to me is that these pieces' intimate qualities make up "the big picture." It is my pleasure to portray a "portrait" of the details and mood that many don't take the time to stop and see. Some details are unnecessary. My job is to choose and decide which details stay to elevate the disposition and even the role of the subject I am portraying."
<br><br>
"Society would truly benefit from taking the time to stop and smell, see, hear, taste and touch what may otherwise go unnoticed."
