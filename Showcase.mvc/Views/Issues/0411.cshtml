Susan Rios' ability to evoke familiar feelings through her paintings is the hallmark of her work. A nationally renowned artist, Susan works with a palette of soft, warm colors, inviting viewers to step into a world where one tranquil moment can last an eternity. 
<br><br>  
Largely self-taught, Susan's artistic potential was apparent even as a child. Her love of the outdoors inspired her to begin drawing scenes from nature. Today, she continues to find inspiration in the gentle-hearted beauty of everyday life. 
<br><br>  
Susan's surroundings are reminiscent of the images she paints. Working from her cozy, home-based studio in Southern California, her artwork reflects that coziness, drawing the viewer in for a stroll in the garden, a cup of tea, or a long overdue rest in a quiet place. 
<br><br>  
A professional artist for 30 years, Susan spent the early years of her career working as a floral designer. She soon discovered that blending flowers was similar to mixing colors on a palette. To this day, flowers are an ever-present motif in many of her paintings. 
<br><br>  
Susan's career started in 1976, when she left her job as a floral designer to be a stay at home mom for her daughter, Olivia. Working with a friend who became her business mentor, Susan started selling her work at sidewalk art shows, and then through a few galleries in Southern California. 
<br><br>  
After two years with her first art publisher, Naif International, Susan's work drew the attention of Martin Lawrence Limited Editions, and for ten years her work was sold through Martin Lawrence, along with over 50 limited edition prints published from her original works. A book, "The Art of Susan Rios" was published by Martin Lawrence in1988. 
<br><br>  
Along the way, Susan's art has appeared on calendars, note cards, puzzles, needlepoint kits, and several books for Harvest House Publishers. Currently two sets of tea dishes designed by Susan are available through Glory International, Inc., (also available on Susan's website), along with a current book of her work, "Susan Rios - A Brush With Romance", published by Enfantino Publishing in 2009. 
<br><br>  
An active participant in causes that touch her heart, Susan devotedly supports charities and nationwide organizations including the Los Angeles Children's Hospital, Saddleback Community Outreach, (Orange County, Ca), The Taylor Family Foundation,  Make a Wish Foundation. The Lotus Project, and Leeza Gibbon's Circle of Care, (for patients and caregivers dealing with Alzheimer's). 
<br><br>  
Over the last quarter century, Susan's work has attracted the attention of many noted collectors and celebrities who have added her paintings to their private collection such as Jane Seymour, Priscilla Presley, Britney Spears, Mr. and Mrs. Brian Wilson, (of the Beach Boys), Mr. and Mrs. Bruce Dern, Phyllis George, Ann Gillian, Sandy Duncan, Shelley Fabres, Andre Agassi, and Mrs. Walter Mathau. 
<br><br>  
The timeless, enduring beauty of her work continues to garner attention from art enthusiasts, young and old alike. The emotional impact of her paintings, however, is the most important element. As an artist, she says, that is her true reward.
