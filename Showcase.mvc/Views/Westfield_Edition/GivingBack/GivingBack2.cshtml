    The Emmanuel Cancer Foundation is New Jersey's oldest free, in-home, counseling and support agency. For more than 30 years, ECF has provided services to any New Jersey family whose child has been diagnosed with cancer. ECF's three pillars of support include: in-home counseling and advocacy services from a professional Caseworker; material assistance such as groceries, holiday and birthday gifts for the child and siblings, toys, clothing, and household items; and emergency financial aid to prevent eviction, loss of utilities, and to help with paying for meals for parents who are in the hospital with their child, as well as contributions towards the high cost of burials. 
    <br /><br />    
    With no government or United Way funding, ECF relies on the community for support. There are many opportunities for volunteers and all are always welcome to join our vibrant and loyal team. Please contact us at: <a href="mailto:emmanuelcancer@gmail.com">
