    Organization Serving Today’s Girls Needs Volunteers
</div><br>
  <br>
    According to a recent poll, 88 percent of volunteers queried said they believe their life is better because they volunteer with Girl Scouts.


    (NAPS)—If you think the Girl Scouts of today are just about camping and cookies, you’re in for a big surprise; fun, new experiences are the main focus.
    <br /><br />
    Today’s Girl Scouts have turned ordinary household items into robots, hiked the Appa­lachian Trail, and more. Girls Scouts get to participate in environmental programs and events, as well as explore the arts, STEM, business and entrepreneurship activities with a focus on fun and adventure.
    <br /><br />
    One thing these various programs all have in common is that they need the support of volunteers to be successful. In fact, the need for volunteers nationally is one reason there are some 30,000 girls currently on lists, waiting for an opening in an organization that’s supported by volunteers.

    <B>Volunteers Needed</B>
    <br /><br />
    Says Anna Maria Chávez, CEO of Girl Scouts of the USA, “We know the majority of volunteers feel their Girl Scout experience has helped them both personally and professionally, but in many places throughout the country, the lack of volunteers is what keeps girls on waiting lists.
    <br /><br />
    “Every adult who volunteers for Girl Scouts can help us bring fun, new experiences to at least five girls. Imagine what that can do to shape the next generation of female leaders.”
    <br /><br />
    <b>Making Lives Better</b>
    <br /><br />
    Whether you have just a few hours per month to give or more; whether you want to participate in exciting activities or share your passion regarding a favorite topic; whether you are looking to make new friends or serve your neighborhood, Girl Scouts will welcome your support.
    <br /><br />
    Successful volunteers come from all walks of life. After receiving training from their local Girl Scout council, volunteers introduce girls to new experiences that show them they’re capable of more than they ever imagined.
    <br /><br />
    Volunteers serve as cheerleaders, guides and mentors helping girls develop skills and confidence that will last long after the programs and events are over.
    <br /><br />
    <b>Volunteers Benefit</b>
    <br /><br />
    According to a recent poll conducted by the Girl Scouts of the USA, it is not just girls who benefit from taking part in its programs. Ninety-four percent of volunteers queried said they made new friends, 88 percent reported they believe their life is better because they volunteer with Girl Scouts, and two-thirds believe their volunteer experience has helped them professionally.
    <br /><br />
    Ninety-five percent of Girl Scout volunteers said they are happy knowing they are making girls’ lives better.
