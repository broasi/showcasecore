                Research has shown that children who are prepared for medical procedures experience less fear and anxiety and will have better long-term adjustment to medical challenges. Children who engage in therapeutic play with a trained professional exhibit less emotional distress, increased cooperation, and fewer negative physiological responses.
                <br><br>
                Child life interventions can increase cooperation and help to reduce procedural and post-procedural pain. Providing support for family members enhances psychosocial outcomes for young patients. A parent or caregiver�s behavior and anxiety levels are strongly correlated with how a child will respond to hospitalization.
                <br><br>
                As a result of the increased need for such services, I am happy to announce the opening of my new practice The Next Step: Partners in Psychosocial Care.  A Certified Child Life Specialist practicing in a hospital setting for the past 25 years, I am excited to finally be taking my expertise beyond the hospital walls and into the community. Families affected by trauma and medical crises often feel lost and unsupported beyond the hospital setting. Our goal is to improve the quality of life for affected families by addressing psychological needs that often go unattended.
                <br><br>
                At The Next Step, we work with a wide range of psychosocial issues for children, adolescents, and their families related to chronic illness, injury, trauma, grief, and loss, assisting our clients in coping with these difficult issues and facilitating the healing process. We offer a highly personalized service for both families and medical staff in a comfortable and supportive environment, and home visits are available for the homebound.  We also offer assistance in helping children cope with medical procedures and doctor/dental appointments.
                <br><br>
                The Next Step: Partners In Psychosocial Care is a joint project with Rosanne Tobey, LPC, founder and director of Calm and Sense Therapy. Rosanne brings many years� experience in counseling and private practice. Our shared goal is to assist those undergoing treatment or coping with another�s chronic illness.  Our objective is to assist our clients by increasing understanding of their situations and identifying their needs. We will support them in finding their own strengths, enhancing their ability to cope, and bringing a sense of normalcy and consistency back to their everyday lives that will promote hope and healing.  It is our belief that our combined experience will help us to create a comprehensive practice for this underserved community.
                <br><br>
                In addition, assistance in program development, parent workshops, and presentations are available on a consulting basis. Treatment specialization includes, but is not limited to:  anxiety or fears related to illness, palliative care, medical preparation through play, coping techniques, distraction techniques, dealing with a parent�s serious illness, preparing children for visiting a funeral home, and Reiki Healing.
                <br><br>
                WE are finally ready to take The Next Step!  
                <br><br>
                We hope you and your friends will be too!
