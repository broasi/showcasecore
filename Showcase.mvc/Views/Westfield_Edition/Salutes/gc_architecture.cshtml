                For 13 years, Angelo Cannizzo has been more than an architect � he�s been a guiding force in helping people turn their visions into reality when it comes to creating the home they�ve imagined.  He�s been able to help homeowners translate their ideas from something vague into specifically, well-thought-out plans and designs that fulfill their dreams *and* meet their budgetary considerations.  Now Angelo, a member of the American Institute of Architects, is Principal Architect at GC Architecture, LLC of Scotch Plains � and he can put his decade-plus of experience to work for you when you�re ready to turn the home you�ve been talking about into the home you�ve always wanted!

                Creating beautiful designs while within a client�s budgets make GC a standout in their field.  Angelo, a Scotch Plains resident for seven years, knows just what to ask and what to recommend when helping clients get a project off the ground. And often, the most critical questions revolve around a budget � that�s where Angelo can offer expertise that�s tough to find anywhere else!
                <br><br>
                �Budget drives the process,� Angelo says.  �Because part of our business is also in construction, we have a clear understanding of what things will cost and how long a project will take to complete. We also know how to simplify a design structurally to make the whole process more efficient.�
                <br><br>
                Angelo and his team also do construction projects on the side, and being involved in the building end of the business gives him the experience to produce highly-detailed plans and drawings that lead to a smoother construction process when the work begins.  He�s able spot and eliminate potential mistakes when a project is still in the drawing stages instead of in the field � saving his clients time, money, and headaches in the long run.
                <br><br>
                As the economy has turned, people are becoming more particular about how to tackle a home renovation or addition � they�re conscious of resale values down the road, and they want to maximize the space they already have.  About half of GC�s clients come to Angelo with a clear idea of what they�re looking to accomplish, while half have more general ideas and look to Angelo to flesh them out.  And he doesn�t disappoint � a standout addition, for example, is one that doesn�t stand out from the original structure.  The before and after pictures on his website, www.gcarchitecturellc.com, illustrate perfectly the level of detail, professionalism, and care Angelo puts into every job.
                <br><br>
                �We take a good deal of pride in what we do, and in the relationships we build with our clients,� Angelo says, noting that roughly 90% of his business is residential additions, renovations and new construction.  And word of mouth is spreading: jump on a Facebook group page for Scotch Plains or the surrounding towns, and when residents are looking for architect renovations, you�re likely to see GC Architecture earning raves from past clients.
