    Lauren Holstein is the columnist behind the Showcase Magazine�s On the Record in NYC. She joined our team in 2011 to write Salutes and has since expanded her role to serve as an Advertising Executive and to later start her own column.
    <br /><br />  
    Lauren�s trips to and from Manhattan--where she now lives--involved completing a city bucket list with friends, which inspired her to share New York�s staple experiences with Showcase readers. Whether it�s a museum, restaurant, or outdoor experience, New York City has a lot of people and places to explore.
    <br /><br />  
    As a Warren native, Lauren graduated from Watchung Hills Regional High School and later attended the University of Maryland where she majored in Broadcast Journalism with a concentration in sociology. She previously interned with companies such as the Rachael Ray Show and NBCUniversal.
    <br /><br />  
    Since then Lauren has gained experience as a Production Assistant and Assistant Editor for USA Today Sports. She is currently the Client Operations Manager for a mobile video-editing software.
    <br /><br />  
    When Lauren is not working or exploring the city, she can be found in a spin class, on the beach, or discussing the latest pop culture and entertainment news.
