                Invites: Traditional or Digital?

    All the hype these days is the transition into digital communication. And sometimes, sending an email is a more efficient way of communicating than the more traditional approaches. But sometimes, however, it is not.
    <br><br>
    When planning events, you may be faced with this dilemma: do I print and mail invitations, or do I create a Facebook Event Page/use an Evite email? I�m here to tell you that none of these options are right or wrong. What you choose should fit your event and your guests. Let�s look a little more closely at when to use both options:
    <br><br>
    1. Traditional Invitations<br><br>
    Traditional invitations consist of those you may buy at a Paper Source or Papyrus and either fill out by hand or have customized to your liking. People oftentimes shy away from traditional invitations now for a couple of reasons, often being that they take time to create and send, and also that they may imply a formality to the event they are hosting. For example, do you need to print and mail invitations to a backyard BBQ to celebrate the end of summer? Not necessarily. Some people may (I would), just because they enjoy that sort of thing, but no, you do not have to.
    <br><br>
    So when should you opt for this type of invite? Traditional invitations should � without a doubt � be used for formal events. Weddings, Bar Mitzvahs, First Communions, Sweet 16s...these are all examples of events where traditional invitations are the proper way of reaching out to your guests. Sending and receiving mail is becoming a lost art, and for events that still have some cultural/historical tradition to them, this is just proper invite etiquette.
    <br><br>
    Another time to consider traditional invitations over digital ones is when you take a look at your guest list and notice that many of them may not be technologically savvy enough to receive the digital version. For example, my grandmothers. Any events that they � and their generation � will be attending, that I will be hosting, will be traditional invitation only.
    <br><br>
    Now if you wanted, you can do the half traditional-half digital method, where you send all digital invitations but print a few to send to those who would respond better to traditional ones. Personally, I prefer keeping everything consistent that way my RSVP list will be in one format, in one place, and my event stays organized. But it�s something to consider if that works for you.
    <br><br>
    2. Digital Invitations<br><br>
    So that backyard BBQ you�re having since summer�s ending? Totally appropriate for you to send digital invitations for that. As far as digital invitations go, I would recommend staying away from Facebook Event Pages. They are great for many things, but since so many people use them, they sometimes get lost in the shuffle. A good example of when to use a Facebook Event Page is if your event is super, super casual. Kind of like an �I�m having a BBQ, anyone can come!� situation. It�ll give you an approximate head count � since people tend to RSVP on Facebook to things and then forget to record them in their planner � and allow you to kind of get an idea of what to expect.
    <br><br>
    If you really like using Facebook Events, don�t let me deter you; they have gotten better now that Facebook sends notifications about events, and even exports events into iCal. I just think it�s literally the most casual way you can invite people somewhere. Think word of mouth, but digitally, one time, to the masses. For someone who handwrites everything, this is not my favorite.
    <br><br>
    What I do like to use is Evites. Evites are literally digital invitations. Think: going online to make a print-out invite and then instead of printing it out, you type in all of your guests email addresses and it just gets sent to them. The site also records your RSVPs for you that way everything is kept track of. These can be really fun, and I think are great for events that are mild to moderately formal. Housewarming parties, adult birthday parties, going away parties.... all examples of when an evite is a prime method of inviting.
    <br><br>
    So there you have it!
