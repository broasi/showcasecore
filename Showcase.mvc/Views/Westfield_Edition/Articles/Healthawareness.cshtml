    If you are experiencing lower back pain, you are not alone. Back pain is the leading cause of disability in Americans under 45 years old. It is also considered the �most common� type of pain, according to the National Institute of Health Statistics. It is estimated that 75 to 85 percent of all Americans will experience a form of lower back pain during their lifetime. The good news though is that in 90% of all cases, pain can improve without surgery, according to the American Association of Neurological Surgeons.
    <br /><br />
    Some of the major causes of lower back pain are herniated discs, osteoarthritis, sciatica, bulging discs and injuries obtained from car accidents or during exercise. The lumbar spine, which consists of five vertebrae in the lower portion of your spine, contains discs that act like shock absorbers for the spinal bones. These discs allow you to turn and bend and they help with nerve placement. If the disc bulges or becomes degenerated, it can put pressure on the nerves, causing severe pain in the lumbar spine and in the lower extremities. Sometimes damaging a nerve in your lumber spine can cause pain all the way down to your toes.
    <br /><br />
    People with lower back pain often try to deal with their pain by taking medication or limiting their activity levels. However, at some point the pain gets to the point where they need to do something different. Many patients are unaware that there are options that can provide relief from the pain that doesn�t involve surgery or a lifetime of pain medications. Often they have been told that surgery is their only option to find relief.  We are here to tell you that there is a non-surgical solution that has helped thousands avoid surgery and regain their freedom.  Our unique combination of treatments has been successful for many residents of Union and Somerset County.
