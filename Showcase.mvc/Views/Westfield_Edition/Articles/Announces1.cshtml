    For years, Peak Medical has helped the residents of Berkeley Heights and surrounding communities find relief from severe and chronic pain by providing an integrated approach to care. We feel that by having the eyes and ears of several different specialists, our patients receive better results. Our pain management center features the latest technology and treatments to ensure that our patients are receiving the best care possible. By utilizing a comprehensive approach, we offer the finest quality in non-surgical treatments. We combine multiple disciplines, including physical therapy, chiropractic care, and acupuncture, to address a complete range of chronic and acute pain disorders. Our experience combined with the latest FDA approved technology provides amazing results for our patients. Additionally, with the personal attention that we give each individual, our patients feel like they�re part of our family. We�re eager to help people find viable solutions to their pain through our patient-centered approach.
   <br /><br />
    As part of our ongoing evolution and expansion, we have recently added a new team member who continues to increase our expertise and understanding of chronic pain treatments. With over 20 years of experience in Internal Medicine and Osteopathy, Dr. Richard D. Berardi, D.O brings additional relief to Peak Medical�s patients through his whole body approach to medicine and wellness. For several years, he has been recognized as one of �America�s Top Physicians� in Osteopathic Medicine from Consumers Research Council (2011-2015). As an osteopathic physician, Dr. Berardi has received extensive training in musculoskeletal conditions and non-surgical treatments that have been proven to alleviate pain.
    <br /><br />
    Osteopathic medicine focuses on the integrated whole body approach, treating the underlying causes and not just the symptoms. Doctors of Osteopathy are known for gaining a deep understanding of all the underlying issues that may contribute to a given condition. This level of patient involvement helps doctors provide solutions and treatments that may have been missed if the diagnosis was only based on symptomatic issues. The benefits of Osteopathic Manipulation include relief of acute and chronic pain, ease of movement, improved posture and a sense of emotional well-being. This medical specialty integrates seamlessly into our progressive pain management program and will continue to provide our patients with quick and effective pain relief.
    <br /><br />
    Peak Medical has extensive experience in helping patients with a variety of chronic and severe pain conditions, including osteoarthritis, sciatica, stenosis, herniated discs, neck pain, neuropathy, joint pain, sports injuries, and many more. Many individuals suffering from pain have tried several different treatment options with little to no results. After seeing our doctors at Peak Medical, they begin to feel immediate relief and quickly recognize that having the right technology in the right hands makes all the difference.
