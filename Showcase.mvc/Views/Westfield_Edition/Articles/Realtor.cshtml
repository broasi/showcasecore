    Selling a senior�s home can be complicated. Help is on the way!
</div><br><br>

    <br /><br />
    Many people have bought and sold homes. But selling a senior�s home can be much more complicated, due to the number of unique issues and decisions � and sometimes the number of people involved. That�s where the help of a Seniors Real Estate Specialist� comes in handy.
    <br><br>
    Though seniors usually make their own decision to sell, it is not uncommon for their adult children to help them sort through these and other issues:
    <ul>
    <li>Is moving the best alternative? If so, where? Have other options been explored?</li>
    <li>Are close family members on board with a decision to sell?</li>
    <li>What is the best way to downsize a lifetime�s worth of possessions and family heirlooms?</li>
    <li>What are the tax-related implications of a sale?</li>
    </ul>
    The financial, logistical and emotional issues involved in a move can be stressful for a family to navigate. Senior parents and their adult children may feel they are in unfamiliar waters as they deal with these questions.
    <br><br>
    A real estate professional who has experience in seniors� issues, and who can put you in contact with other similarly-trained professional advisors, can be an invaluable resource at this time. A Seniors Real Estate Specialist� (SRES�) is a Realtor� who is uniquely qualified to assist seniors in housing sales and purchases. Their mission is to help seniors and their families navigate the maze of financial, legal and emotional issues that accompany the sale of the home.
    <br><br>
    The SRES� designation is awarded only to Realtors� who have additional education on how to help seniors and their families with later-in-life real estate transactions. They also draw upon the expertise of a network of senior specialists, such as estate planners, CPAs, and eldercare lawyers, and they are familiar with local community resources and services. They know who can help stage a home to make it more appealing to perspective buyers. They can bring in a team to help organize a lifetime�s worth of possessions, and they know who can remedy the termite problem or remove the oil tank before the closing.
    <br><br>
    Selling a senior�s most valued and valuable asset, their home, and the subsequent move, often requires unique expertise on a number of different fronts. One compelling reason to choose an SRES� is that you�ll gain access to their network of related service professionals. For seniors, that includes specialists across a wide array of financial, legal, property and personal services, from estate planning to downsizing.
    <br><br>
    Sometimes an older parent has a trusted attorney and accountant. If they don�t, an SRES� can usually refer them and their adult children to elder law attorneys, estate planners, financial planners and tax advisors with experience in elder issues.
    <br><br>
    You can count on a Seniors Real Estate Specialist� to help guide you through the process and take care of the special considerations, making the difficult transaction less stressful and more successful.
