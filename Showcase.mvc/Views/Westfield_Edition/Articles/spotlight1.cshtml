    For the past several months, Peak Medical in Berkeley Heights has been undergoing a complete renovation and expansion to meet the needs of our expanding patient base. The construction is complete, and we are excited to invite area residents in to experience the �Peak� in non-surgical, drug-free pain treatment options. This remodel and expansion were carefully planned to continue to improve the services and patient experience, by continuing to offer the latest in non-surgical pain treatment solutions.  Peak Medical has been built on the premise of providing the best treatments through caring, compassionate and knowledgeable professionals.
    <br /><br />
    Peak Medical has extensive experience in helping patients with a variety of chronic and severe pain conditions � osteoarthritis, sciatica, stenosis, herniated discs, neck pain, neuropathy, joint pain, sports injuries, and many more. Many people who contact us are frustrated with the poor results they have seen through other clinics, and they are still dealing with the pain.  Once they understand our approach and begin to feel relief, they recognize that having the right technology in the right hands, makes all the difference.
    <br /><br />
    For years, Peak Medical has helped the residents of Berkeley Heights and many surrounding communities to find relief from severe and chronic pain, by enlisting a team approach to care. We feel that by having the eyes and ears of several different specialists, our patients receive better results. We continually invest in the latest technology and treatments, to ensure that our patients are receiving the best care possible. Peak Medical enlists a multidisciplinary approach to dealing with pain. On staff, we have medical doctors, doctors of physical therapy, chiropractic physicians, acupuncturists and more.  All of whom are trained in treating pain non-surgically. This experience combined with the latest FDA cleared technology provides amazing results for our patients. Plus, with the personal attention that we give each individual, it is not uncommon for patients to feel as though they are part of our family. We feel the same way, and are anxious to help people find viable solutions to their pain.
