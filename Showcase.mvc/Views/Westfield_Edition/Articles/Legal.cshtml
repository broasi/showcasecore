    KEEPING YOUR LEGAL SKELETONS IN THE CLOSET<br /><br />
    An Overview to Expunging Your Criminal Record
<br /><Br />
<br />
</div> 
<br>
    What do a recent college graduate, a 55-year-old woman aspiring to be a nursing assistant, and a 40-something year old businessman all have in common?  All three contacted me within the last several months when the applications they filed for a job, license or special privilege were denied because of their brush with the criminal justice system.
    <br /><br />
    The college graduate was attempting to join the military when questions arose regarding an arrest from a few years earlier wherein the charges were dismissed.  The woman applied to the State to become a certified nursing assistant, but was denied due to a fine she paid for a shoplifting offense in a municipal court in 1996.  Finally, the businessman who travels often applied for a TSA PreCheck that allows for expedited screening at airports.  He was denied this application because he plead guilty to a municipal court offense sometime in the mid 1980�s.
    <br /><br />
    Records of any involvement with the criminal justice system do not automatically go away with the passage of time.  A criminal background check will not reveal only convictions, but also arrests even if the case was ultimately dismissed.  In New Jersey, an expungement is not a pardon, however, under most circumstances, it does allow a person to legally say that they have never been arrested, charged or convicted of the expunged offense.
    <br /><br />
    It is a common misconception that a person�s criminal history only becomes an issue when applying for a job.  However, background checks are required more often. For example if you wish to adopt a child, apply for a permit to purchase a firearm, coach a youth sports team, be licensed in the medical, legal or financial field, or pass a security clearance, a background check is required.  Additionally, people have lost their jobs after their employers obtain information that reveals a past criminal record.
    <br /><br />
    With limited exceptions, by law, most offenses can be expunged from your record. There are, however, waiting periods to apply for an expungement.  For an indictable offense (felony) a person must wait ten years from the time they are discharged from probation/parole and all their fines were paid. A recent amendment to this statute permits a reduced wait time of five years for certain indictable offenses if it is in the public interest. A disorderly or petty disorderly person�s offense (misdemeanor) that was handled in a municipal court has a five year waiting period, whereas a boro or municipal ordinance has a two year waiting period. One exception to this rule is for driving while intoxicated (DWI) convictions or any type of motor vehicle offense; these records cannot be expunged. For people that were admitted into the Pre-Trial Intervention Program (PTI) or received a conditional discharge in municipal court, there is a six month waiting period from the time the case was dismissed.  There is no minimum waiting period to apply for an expungement of arrest records, for charges that were ultimately dismissed. Finally, if a person was adjudicated delinquent as a juvenile, there is a 5 year waiting period from the date of the completion of their supervision.
    <br /><br />
    To have your record expunged, you must make an application to the Superior Court of New Jersey in the county where the offense took place.  Generally, the process takes approximately 2 months for the court to review your application and determine whether you meet the legal requirements to have your criminal history expunged. After a Judge signs the Order for Expungement, the Order is sent to various law enforcement agencies where the expunged record is actually �cleared� from the person�s files.  In the overwhelming majority of cases, the applicant does not have to appear in court during this process.
    <br /><br />
    Expunging your criminal history at the earliest possible opportunity is the one way you can evict the unfortunate skeleton from your closet so it can no longer haunt you in the present.
