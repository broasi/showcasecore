            Lately, I have been hearing a lot about Anguilla.  �An-whatta?� you may be saying to yourself.  I�ll admit that I said the same thing before I went down for a visit in June.  Anguilla (helpful hint: rhymes with gorilla) is a small British territory in the Caribbean, adjacent to St. Martin (or Sint Maarten for all you Dutch folks out there).
            <br /><br />

            Most Anguillans may tell you that the island has gotten too populated, but let�s put it into perspective, shall we?  They are talking about a time not too long ago when there were only 7,000 inhabitants.  In a short time, that number has doubled and they now have six (gasp!) traffic lights on the island.  However, to those of us living in the tri-state area, Anguilla is a quiet dream.
            <br /><br />
            I went to Anguilla by way of its neighboring island, flying into St. Martin and taking a 30-minute speed boat ride over to Blowing Point.  As we first headed out, I thought the choppy water was due to the passing St. Barth�s ferry, but it turned out that it was just very windy out on the channel.   If you�re looking to avoid this, you can take a small plane from a nearby island.  Commercial jets do not fly directly into Anguilla.  We arrived into a very small terminal that, truth be told, had seen better days.  Passing through customs, I tried not to squeal because I had just gotten my third passport stamp of the day.  For someone that is trying to fill all pages before it expires, that is very exciting!
            <br /><br />
            There are very few luxury resorts on the island and most of them have seen their heyday already.  I was parking it for the week at the five year old Viceroy.  It was my first time staying at the hotel brand, so I was excited to see what it offered.  My taxi van rolled up to the property and we were greeted by a gorgeous entrance complete with fountains, fire, and a long drive lined with mile high palm trees.  Arriving at the lobby felt like arriving at a private home.  Dark woods, a massive table filled with succulents, and super modern furniture filled the space.  The staff led me to my room where I was treated with sights of massive granite ceilings and dramatic views.
            <br /><br />
            I could write an entire article on my room alone, but I won�t.  I will leave it to these words: private plunge pool on my terrace overlooking the ocean, modern kitchen and dining room, and walk-in closet bigger than my Hoboken apartment.  It was certainly spectacular, but who spends much time in their room anyway?  With two beaches, each in a different turquoise bay and multiple infinity pools, there was much to do (and not do).
            <br /><br />
            There�s no getting around the fact that incidentals at the resort were very expensive.  For lunch, I had a salad with shrimp in it and a glass of ros� and it set me back $75.  It appears you also pay for the lunch time view.  There are, however, many fantastic restaurants on the island.  In fact, you may have heard of Blanchard�s (www.blanchardsrestaurant.com).  It�s owned by Bob and Melinda Blanchard and was made famous by their book A Trip to the Beach in which they chronicle giving up their life in Vermont to move to the Caribbean.  You will not have a bad meal here, I promise.  And it seems to be that way in most places, drawing many talented chefs in.
            <br /><br />
            For me, Anguilla is a haven for tranquility.  Friendly and helpful people, quiet luxury, and the overall general attitude that there is much to do if you wanted and a whole lot of nothing to do if you so choose.  One of the hotel staff told me as I was leaving �you�re not saying goodbye forever, you�re saying goodbye with the intent to come back.� And I plan to do just that.
