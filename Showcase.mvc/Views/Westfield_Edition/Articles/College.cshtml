                The SAT Is Changing For 2016 � but next month�s PSAT will be a sneak peek!

            By now parents of high school-aged kids have heard the SAT is changing.  In its first major overhaul in 10 years � when the College Board eliminated analogies, killed Quantitative Comparisons, beefed up the reading passages and appended the essay � the test will change its scoring method, subject matter, essay policy and more to make it a) a better indicator of college readiness, and b) more like the ACT.
            <br /><br />
            (Frankly it�s this second option that I think is the bigger driver behind the College Board�s decision.  The College Board is a business, after all, and it�s hard to imagine the changes aren�t driven by consumer demand.  The ACT gains in popularity every year, and there�s a wide range of colleges around the country that are now SAT and ACT-optional.  The College Board�s changes may be motivated by market share slipping away over the last 10 years.  But I digress.)
            <br /><br />
            The first administration of the new SAT will happen in March 2016 � but the juniors taking that test will preview it next month (along with many sophomores) when they sit for the �new� PSAT.  As a test prep coach and college admissions advisor, each year I�m asked about what students should to do to get ready for the PSAT � if anything at all.  So here�s my take on this new PSAT format:
            <br /><br />
            The PSAT is not, and has never been, a factor in college admissions.  So generally, I don�t recommend doing a lot of extensive work to get ready for it.  Think of the �P� in PSAT as standing for Pre-, Practice, and Preview.  A low score won�t prevent you from getting into college, and a great score won�t get you in.
            <br /><br />
            A great score will, however, put you in contention for a National Merit Scholarship � and while the scholarship amount itself isn�t enormous, the fact that only a fraction of a percent of test-takers will qualify makes this a fantastic addition to a your transcript.  It makes a statement to the colleges to which you�re applying � but unless you feel you might be in serious contention for one, it isn�t something that demands heavy preparation.
            <br /><br />
            Overall, the length of the test will increase from 2:10 to 2:45, while the number of questions moves from 125 to 139.  Students can expect changes in the way questions are phrased and in the skills being tested.  And to line up with the new SAT, students will be scored only on the questions they get right � meaning there�s no longer the need to worry about when to guess vs. when to skip.  They should attempt every single question; there�s no longer an advantage to not attempting certain questions.  (The ACT has always scored their test this way.)
            <br /><br />
            Preliminary reports say that on the SAT the vocabulary being tested will be slightly easier; the Math will get a little harder in that �strategies� won�t be so easy to apply.  The essay will be made optional, and the Writing Skills section will no longer be comprised of individual questions; students will tasked with correcting grammar errors in the context of 3-5 paragraph essays.
            <br /><br />
            A sample PSAT in the new format, along with a full set of answers and explanations, will soon (at the time of this writing) be available for students to download at collegeboard.org.  I definitely encourage students to check this sample out before deciding on a PSAT prep program that might not be necessary!
