       Passion 4 K.I.D.S. (Kids In Desperate Situations) is a 501 (c) (3) non-profit charity dealing with handicapped, neglected, abandoned, abused and underprivileged children of any race, color and creed as well as children in acute, life-threatening, emergency situations in the United States.
       <br /><br />
       These are the �forgotten� children whose young lives have been turned upside down that fall through the cracks with little or no insurance or government programs available to help them. Truly nothing brings us greater joy than to put a smile on their faces and try to lighten their load. Our help wears many faces, depending on each child�s individual circumstances.
       <br /><br />
       Our founders, Charles and Linda Van Kessler, have a passion for kids � their kids, other people�s kids, kids that are hurting, kids that are �special� � any kid!  That�s why they created Passion 4 K.I.D.S.
       <br /><br />
       Charles� passion came from personal experience enduring an �upbringing� rivaling a movie script.  Born in Amsterdam, Holland during World War II, he watched his Jewish father and grandparents be snatched away by the Nazis in front of him at age 2. His Catholic mom couldn�t take care of him so he was placed in a state-run orphanage where he suffered abuse of every kind for 8 years and survived on eating flower bulbs until he could no longer take it and ran away at age 10 drifting all over Holland. He vowed one day to help children, like himself, who needed stability, love and someone to care.
       <br /><br />

       As an empty nester mom who at the time didn�t have any grandchildren to hug, Linda�s arms longed to bring love and happiness to suffering children who needed someone to care enough to help them.
