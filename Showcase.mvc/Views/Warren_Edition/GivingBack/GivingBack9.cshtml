       New Jersey native, Springsteen fan, and ASU Sun Devil for life, Adam Lowy founded Move For Hunger in the summer of 2009. Adam�s family has owned a moving company in New Jersey for over 90 years (dating back to Great-Grandpa Lowy). After years of seeing so much food wasted when people move, Adam decided to take action.
       <br /><br />
       As you may be aware, many people throw out a good deal of �stuff� when they move.  Unfortunately, a lot of this �stuff� is food that could be delivered to a family in need rather than thrown away.  That�s where we come in �

       By teaming up with relocation companies across the country, Move For Hunger is creating one of the nation�s largest year-round service programs.  Our movers offer to pick up the unwanted, non-perishable food items from those who are moving and deliver it to their local food banks.

       <br /><br /><b>Pantene Beautiful Lengths</b>
       <br /><br />
       To us, it�s hair. To women battling cancer, it�s hope.
       <br /><br />
       We know how important the appearance of strong, healthy hair is. For women battling cancer, the appearance of strong, healthy hair is even more important. That�s why we created Pantene Beautiful Lengths, the only program to help women feel like themselves again with free, real-hair wigs. So when you donate 8 inches of hair or $8 dollars to the cause, you�re helping to make sure that happens.
       <br /><br />
       More than 800,000 ponytails donated to date
       <br /><br />
       Our goal is simple. We want to make it possible for women everywhere to share their hair with women who�ve lost theirs. It�s also why we�ve partnered with the American Cancer Society� to make and distribute the wigs.
       <br /><br />
       Thanks to our partnership, we�ve donated 42,000 real-hair wigs to the national American Cancer Society Wig Bank, helping serve those in need every single day. To find out if you�re eligible to receive a free wig, or if there are wigs available in your area, please call the American Cancer Society�s Wig Bank Line at: 1.877.227.1596 or learn more online.

       <b>PetSmart Charities</b>
       <br /><br />
       Every year an estimated 7 million pets enter shelters. Nearly 3 million never find homes. We can change that.
       <br /><br />
       The goal of PetSmart Charities is to find a lifelong, loving home for every pet. We get closer every day with adoption events and centers, pet rescue programs and support for spay/neuter efforts.
       <br /><br />
       Pet homelessness is a huge problem. At PetSmart Charities, we believe the solution is to get pets adopted and prevent unplanned litters.
       <br /><br />
       So, we fund local animal welfare groups to address these two issues. Together, we�re working to end pet homelessness.
       <br /><br />
       PetSmart Charities helps find forever homes for pets�to date, we�ve helped more than 6 million pets. That�s 1 out of every 10 Pet adoptions in North America.
       <br /><br />
       What�s more, every story from PetSmart Charities� adopters celebrates the love that pets bring to their families. That�s our real measure of success.
