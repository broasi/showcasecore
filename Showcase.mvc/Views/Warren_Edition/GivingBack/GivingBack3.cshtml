    <b>The Blinded Veterans Association (BVA)</b> is an organization of blinded veterans helping blinded veterans. Through our service programs, regional groups, resources, and advocacy before the legislative and executive branches of government, we hope to make life better for blinded veterans. We also hope to be there with encouragement and support. There is no charge for any BVA service and membership is not a prerequisite to obtain help. All legally blinded veterans are also eligible for BVA�s assistance whether they become blind during or after active duty military service. 
    <br /><br />    
    To Help and to Learn

    There are many seniors in your community who could use an hour of your time. According to a 2011 report from the U.S. Administration on Aging, there are roughly 11 million seniors living alone in their homes and nearly 1.5 million seniors in nursing homes at any given time. Programs set up through the state and localities, many of which are funded through the Older Americans Act, offer opportunities for these individuals to receive services, and meals, as well as programs to keep them busy and social. These programs thrive on volunteers giving an hour back to the older adults in their community.
    <br /><br />    
    The Got an Hour? Campaign was developed to help local agencies throughout the country attract volunteers to programs that work with seniors. The campaign provides downloadable materials, webinars, and a search tool (powered by <a href="http://VolunteerMatch.org" target="_blank">VolunteerMatch.org</a>) to help connect prospective volunteers with opportunities and programs in their neighborhood.

    We envision a world in which every pet has a lifelong, loving home.
    <br /><br />
