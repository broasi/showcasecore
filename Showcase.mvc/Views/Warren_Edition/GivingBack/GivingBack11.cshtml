       Catholic Charities, Diocese of Metuchen, incorporated in 1982, is a non-profit Agency dedicated to service, quality and outreach for members of the community, especially those who are poor, devalued and in need of help. The Agency, which evolved from the Catholic Welfare Bureau of Trenton founded in 1913, provides programs to the four counties of the Diocese of Metuchen with selected services that reach throughout the State of New Jersey.
       <br /><br />
       Catholic Charities, Diocese of Metuchen, began with seven sites that offered nine programs. In 34 years, it has grown to include more than 23 sites and over 100 programs. This expansion is the direct result of the Agency�s aim to provide service to all those in need regardless of race, religion or ethnicity. To fulfill this commitment, Agency administration has consistently created new, innovative programming that would serve to extend the work of Catholic Charities, Diocese of Metuchen.
       <br /><br />
       In its effort to provide the highest levels of service to all its clients, Catholic Charities, Diocese of Metuchen, uses the principles of quality, creativity, respect and empowerment as the guiding forces behind the Agency�s mission. When reaching out to those in the community needing service, particular attention is given to the poor, undervalued and those who are disenfranchised. Administration and staff members design programs that focus on the value of family, individual knowledge and the right of every client to be treated with dignity and respect.

       <b>About Habitat for Humanity in Monmouth County</b>
       <br /><br />
       Habitat for Humanity in Monmouth County is part of a global, nonprofit housing organization operated on Christian principles that seeks to put God�s love into action by building homes, communities and hope. Habitat for Humanity in Monmouth County is dedicated to eliminating substandard housing locally and worldwide through constructing, rehabilitating and preserving homes; by advocating for fair and just housing policies; and by providing training and access to resources to help families improve their shelter conditions.  Habitat for Humanity was founded on the conviction that every man, woman and child should have a simple, durable place to live in dignity and safety, and that decent shelter in decent communities should be a matter of conscience and action for all.
       <br /><br />
       <b>All are welcome</b>
       <br /><br />
       Habitat for Humanity in Monmouth County has an open-door policy: All who believe that everyone needs a decent, affordable place to live are welcome to help with the work, regardless of race, religion, age, gender, political views or any of the other distinctions that too often divide people. In short, Habitat welcomes volunteers and supporters from all backgrounds and also serves people in need of decent housing regardless of race or religion. As a matter of policy, Habitat for Humanity International and its affiliated organizations do not proselytize. This means that Habitat will not offer assistance on the expressed or implied condition that people must either adhere to or convert to a particular faith, or listen and respond to messaging designed to induce conversion to a particular faith.
