       Answer a letter to Santa written by a child who needs a brighter Christmas.
        <br /><br />
       You can read real letters to Santa from needy kids, take home one or more that move you, and send your gifts directly to the children who wrote the letters.
       <br /><br />
       There�s no middle man or charity; it�s micro-philanthropy, direct from you to a child, when you volunteer in this way.
       <br /><br />
       You�ll catch the true spirit of the holidays, and put smiles on the faces of needy kids on Christmas morning.

       I AM THAT GIRL is a 501(c)3 organization helping girls to transform self-doubt in to self-love by providing a safe space to connect and have honest conversations about things that matter. Every day, girls are bombarded with messages that attack what she is NOT and we work every day to help her love who SHE IS; to see that in herself and inspire that in others.
       <br /><br />
       WE ARE SHIFTING GIRL CULTURE.
       <br /><br />
       Raising the standards for how girls treat themselves, each other, and the world. By building a community for girls to be seen, be heard, and belong, we are giving them something bigger than themselves to stand for and creating a healthier, more powerful world.
