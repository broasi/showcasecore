    Two Warren kids came home with great honors on their shoulders, on President's Day weekend.  Thelonious Rowley (15) and his sister Portia Rowley (12) competed in the 2015 TaeKwonDo Canada Open  (February 13 - February 15). The event drew in elite athletes from 27 nations, including Korea, Germany, Mexico, Chile, and many more. The three day international tournament hosts star athletes as they compete for important ranking points towards their seeding at the World Championships.
    <br /><br />
    Accompanied by their coach Master Israel Nava of Nava's Martial Arts, Thelonious competed and won Bronze medal in the Junior division (ages 15-17). Portia competed and won Gold, in the Cadet division (ages 12-14).  Thelonious was a US national Gold medal holder at the age of 12 while Portia was a US national Bronze medal holder at the age of 11. The week prior to attending Canada Open, on February 7, they both competed in New York State Championship in Queens College, winning Silver and Gold in their respective division. Both are proud residents of Warren, attending Watchung Hills Regional High School and Warren Middle School, respectively.
    <br /><br />
    Both are passionate about the sport, have been training since age 4. They each spent 2 hours training daily at Nava's Martial Arts in North Plainfield, coached by Master Israel Nava. And they regularly train at Warren's Mountain Fitness for strength and agility.
    <br /><br />
    They will be going to the National Championship once again in July 2015, representing New Jersey. Way to go kids!!
