When it comes to getting started with anything, for me the first step is often the hardest.    Seven years ago when I decided to go green and live my life with sustainability as one of my guiding values, it was definitely not an easy change.  The more environmental issues I learned about, the more overwhelmed I got, there is just so much to change and do!!  How do I reduce my carbon footprint when I didn�t have an electric or hybrid car? I don�t own my home so how do I improve the building to be more energy efficient? Do I just throw out all the toxic cleaners and product I currently own? Where do I start when I can�t do it all at once?  To over come the stress and guilty conscience of not living a 100% green life immediately, I took on the motto inspired by the modern minimalist architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe -�Less is More�.  This motto helped me mentally simplify things so I can begin to take action.
<br /><br />
One of the first thoughts that led me to this motto was that �Well it seems that our basic existence is the problem�.  We, humans, create Green House Gas emissions, consume natural resources and harm the earth�s balanced ecosystems.  So the only solution I can come up with, that is NOT extinguishing human kind is simply decrease or lessens the damage we do.  
<br /><br />
Then I had to accept the fact that the world we live in, the supporting system in which we access daily is not 100% sustainable-yet.  At some point of the supply chain or manufacturing or delivery, the �Green� is tainted.   I may be able to purchase an electric car, but the electricity I will use to charge it may not be green energy due to lack of access to green energy.   So in reality I can only do so much and need to stop panicking about not being able to achieve 100% green living.  
<br /><br />
Just imagine going green with doing �Less�, how easy is that!   I focused on two categories Green House Gas Emissions and environmental impacts.  Less cost was also an important criteria and driving factor on all decision.  It was quite easy to find many opportunities to make a choice that is �Less�.  Here are some samples from my list:
<br /><br />
Less Green House Gas Emissions (GHG)
<ul>
<li>I learned to drive more efficiently to use less gas with less time idling, less brake usage and hard accelerations.</li>
<li>Planning the route of the errand with less amount of time in traffic and mileage.  </li>
<li>Finding opportunities to carpool or take public transportation, which can also save on tolls and parking costs.  </li>
<li>Use less electricity in general is a good way to reduce GHG emissions as the production of electricity is one of the main contributors.  I had developed a habit of looking at use of electricity as also money being drained, I happily turn off or unplug any unused devices to stop the draining of my bank account!</li>
<li>Having less electronic devices was even better as there are way too many electronic gadgets that seem useful but no more functional than the good old fashion tools.  Such as the manual pencil sharpeners that does as good a job as the electronic ones and cheaper to buy.</li>
</ul>
Less Environmental Impacts
<ul>
<li>Choosing to eat less pesticide by buying organic foods whenever possible.  The organic farming practices are really more than just less pesticides, it is much better for the land and everyone�s health farmers and consumers.</li>
<li>Using cleaners with less toxic chemicals and hazardous warnings.  It�s amazing how easy and cheap it can be to create your own homemade natural cleaning solutions.</li>
<li>Using less water by not letting water run without a purpose.  Such as using a cup to collect water for rinsing when brushing teeth.  Another natural resource that I look at as wasting money and draining my bank account.</li>
<li>Stop the disposable cups for drinking.  Use a mug for drinking needs at work. I was happy to donate my unused mugs from home to the office; it also gave me more cabinet space!</li>
<li>Create less garbage that goes to landfill by opting for packing that are recyclable or reusable.  </li>
</ul>
The idea of 100% green or zero impact should be the ultimate goal, but it may not always be practical or financially possible immediately.  It does not make sense to throw out all current non-green cleaners I owned, or anything deemed non-green, I would just be creating instant waste.  I have learned to be patient and maintain determined to do Less to become More green!
