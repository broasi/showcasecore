    WHAT IS A LEGAL GUARDIANSHIP AND WHEN IS ONE NEEDED?<br /><Br />
<br />

    A legal Guardianship is often advisable for two common classes of individuals; 1) mentally incapacitated persons who are over eighteen years of age and, 2) adults who suffer from dementia, Alzheimer�s disease, memory loss, mental illness, or brain injury as a result of an accident.  Additionally, in some circumstances, a Guardianship may be necessary despite the existence of a Power of Attorney.
    <br /><br />
    In general, the Guardianship process is typically begun by a family member who files a legal proceeding in accordance with the New Jersey Rules of Court to have their loved one declared as an incapacitated person and have a Guardian appointed for him or her.  Once appointed, the Guardian is empowered to make virtually all decisions for the incapacitated person - including but not limited to - medical, legal, financial, residential, educational, and employment decisions.  Depending upon the circumstances, a Guardian may also be appointed for limited purposes, e.g., to handle financial matters only.  More specifically, in order to bring a Guardianship proceeding, a family member, or individual seeking Guardianship, must file a Complaint together with an Order to Show Cause that is supported by Affidavits from two treating physicians along with an Affidavit of Assets & Income and a proposed form of Judgment.  Once the Complaint is filed, the Court will appoint an attorney who will prepare a report and make recommendations to the judge regarding the proposed Guardianship, keeping in mind the general welfare of the allegedly incapacitated person.  That report will be used by the court to determine (1) whether the individual is truly mentally incapacitated such that Guardianship is appropriate, and (2) whether the proposed Guardian is an appropriate choice to act as Guardian. The court attorney�s fee is ordinarily paid from the assets of the incapacitated person or, if that is not possible, by the person bringing the action.
    <br /><br />
    Guardianship actions can become complex if there is a question regarding the extent of incapacitation or if the Guardianship is contested by a family member.  Disputed cases often require a court hearing concerning the necessity for Guardianship or the qualifications of the proposed Guardian.
    <br /><br />
    Once appointed, the Guardian has certain duties and obligations to the court.  The Guardian must file within 90 days of the Judgment an inventory of all property and income of the incapacitated person.  The Guardian must also file with the Surrogate�s office an annual report regarding the well-being of the incapacitated person and an annual informal accounting of the incapacitated person�s assets.  Further, the Guardian must advise the Surrogate of any address or telephone number changes of himself/herself or of the incapacitated person.  The Guardian must also advise the Surrogate of any changes in the incapacitated person�s status or health over the course of the Guardianship.
