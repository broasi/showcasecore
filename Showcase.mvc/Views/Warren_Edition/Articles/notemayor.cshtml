Note from the Mayor of Berkeley Heights</div> 
<br>
Dear Neighbors and Friends,
<br /><br />

It is with great pleasure that I write to you about the upcoming holiday season. The Christmas Season has always been very special to me, as I am sure it is for you and your family. After a 39 year career in retailing, I can now enjoy all that this season has to offer.
<br /><br />
Our local retailers and shops are gearing up for the all important holiday season and it is important that we support our local merchants. I am very proud of the diverse retail stores and shops that we have here in Berkeley Heights. There are jewelry stores, like J. Michaels Jewelers all the way to Pet Supplies Plus for that special gift for Sparky. If you can't find what you are looking for or are in a pinch at the last minute, how about a gift certificate to one of the many new restaurants or eateries that have opened in our town like Giovanni's, Nagoya, Strega and don't forget that tasty dessert at Yogoccino. If you still are looking for that perfect gift, how about a gift certificate for a "Day of Beauty and Pampering" at one of our salons like Sublime or Libase or a "get ready for spring" certificate from Electric Beach Tanning or Massage Envy. Ladies, don't forget that man in your life. Grant his wish with a gift certificate for that special something from Berkeley Hardware and don't forget to stop in and visit Berkeley's Cuts for Kids to get the little ones ready for the holiday season.
<br /><br />
Why fight traffic, waste gas and time searching for that elusive parking spot with so many choices right here "In Our Downtown in Your Home Town?"
<br /><br />
Finally, when it comes to that big holiday mealâ€¦Guys, give your wife a treat and have it catered by Stop and Shop or Goodman's Deli. It's the gift of not cooking and cleaning up after that big meal that will be remembered. Don't forget to get your holiday flowers and centerpieces at Hall's or Dean's Greens.
<br /><br />
I hope I have given you some gift giving ideas for the upcoming holiday season. Whatever holiday you celebrate, have a safe one. I wish all of you a very Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah, Happy Kwanzaa, Happy Fest of us for the rest of us.
<br /><br /><br />
