    <b>Jim and Karen Zilinski</b> � On Aug 10, 2006 Janet Zilinski was running laps at the ECP. She collapsed and went into cardiac arrest and died later that evening. October of that year the Janet Memorial Fund was started by her parents, family and friends. Their soul mission is to raise awareness for youth AED readily accessible training in CPR. Their big accomplishment was passing the �Janet�s Law� which requires every school K-12 private and public onsite training staff and to have an Emergency Action Plan in an event of cardiac arrest. This went into effect September 1, 2014 and is credited with saving seven lives since. The Janet Zilinski Memorial Fund is the largest nonprofit donating defibulators in NJ. Over 200 AED�s were donated and over 3000 people have been trained in CPR. In 2008 Warren Township was the first to recognize Janet�s Law and have AED�s donated by the Fund for the playing fields. Jim & Karen Zilinski are commended for their tireless efforts through the years which have finally resulted in the passing of Janet�s Law. Thank you

    <b>Bruce Vitale</b> � This year is the 30th anniversary of Warren Township�s fishing derby. It began by one person because of his love for fishing.  Every year for 30 years Bruce Vitale orders the fish to stock the pond, picks up the bait plus gathers donations and prizes. He is very involved in helping the children and parents learn all about fishing on this day. Throughout the day Bruce makes sure he walks around the pond helping the children and parents with tangled lines, adding hooks & bait or instructing the correct way to cast. He is truly dedicated to fishing and wants to make sure every child gets to enjoy the sport as he has for over 60 years. Bruce Vitale thank you for caring about our kids.
