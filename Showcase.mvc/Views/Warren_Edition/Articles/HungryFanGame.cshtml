    <b>ABOUT THE AUTHOR</b><br /><br />
    A passion for sports is in Daina�s blood. She grew up at sporting events and around professional athletes who were clients of her father, David Falk, a pioneer of the sports agent industry. She took this devotion to Duke University, where she played on the Women�s Club Tennis Team and was a dedicated Cameron Crazy.  While at Duke, Daina pursued two other passions�art and food. She lived in Florence and Paris and studied the arts�both fine and culinary. Taking cooking classes while immersed in European culture cemented a lifelong interest in food�both eating and cooking it. Daina came to believe that food wasn�t just a hobby but was an important cultural component of every sports spectator�s experience, both domestically and internationally.
    <br /><br />
    As much as she wanted to continue to cook and eat the kinds of spectator-friendly foods she had grown up loving and enjoyed overseas, Daina quickly saw that with her college playing days over, adjustments to her favorite foods had to be made. She embarked on a journey of healthy eating, which helped her lose 60 pounds.
    <br /><br />
    Returning to the United States with a new perspective, she created Hungry Fan�, a brand marrying food and sports fan culture, so she could share her new perspective with fellow sports addicts. Daina�s also in demand as a celebrity cook on various television programs such as Late Night with Seth Meyers and The Today Show, and in person for professional sports teams, for whom she occasionally serves as a tailgating judge at special events.
    <br /><br />
    Daina�s first cookbook, "The Hungry Fan�s� Game Day Cookbook, " hit the bookshelves in late August 2016. Published by Time Inc., the game day cookbook features her own Fangating� recipes as well as those she�s collected from Olympians and professional athletes such as Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Andre Agassi, Boomer Esiason and Robert Griffin III.
