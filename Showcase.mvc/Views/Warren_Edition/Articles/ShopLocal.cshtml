    Sure, you can get some good
    deals in large department stores,
    but what about the customer
    service? Do you find yourself
    wandering the aisles trying to get
    some help with a product?    <br /><br />

    Well, that won�t happen in a locally
    owned business where customer service is
    their number one priority. Looking for
    something special for your mother�s
    birthday or a graduating senior? Just ask
    and the advice you will receive will be topnotch.
    The salesperson is often the owner,
    and he or she wants your business not only
    today, but in the future as well. They
    genuinely care about their customers and
    reputation, and know their products well
    since they put the time and effort into
    finding unique and quality items. Instead
    of buying something that�s mass-produced
    and can be found anywhere, the
    merchandise one finds in a small
    neighborhood store may even be one-of-akind
    pieces made by local artists.
    <br /><br />
    When you patronize a local
    business, you�re not only supporting
    them, but the community as well.
    Money spent locally is much more
    likely to stay local. These store
    owners often live and shop in the
    same towns that their businesses are
    in; they are our neighbors and
    friends. Many also contribute
    towards local causes that help the
    community. In addition, when we
    support these merchants, it
    encourages even more businesses to
    open which ultimately leads to
    positive growth in towns and even more
    variety to choose from. It�s a win-win
    situation!
    <br /><br />
    Whatever your needs are, you can
    almost always find a small local business
    that offers it. And when it comes to large
    expenses such as renovating your home
    and garden, good advice is invaluable.
    <br /><br />
    Local businesses will focus on what you
    want, and not just what they want to sell.
    They will take the time to get to know you
    and ensure that you�re satisfied with the
    finished product. Same for getting your
    car repaired, or finding someone who can
    do your taxes. Small business owners rely
    on word of mouth and repeat business, so
    they want you to have a positive
    experience. It�s not just a job to them; it�s
    a passion and their way of life.
    <br /><br />
    The same holds true for independent
    restaurants, delis, butchers and specialty
    food stores versus chains. Many of
    you know how good it feels when
    you walk into your local pizzeria,
    deli or restaurant and are greeted by
    name. Having someone know what
    you like and ask if you want �the usual�
    makes you feel appreciated and cared for.
    You�re not just another strange face in a
    line, where you are assisted by different
    people each time, depending on the chain�s
    turnover rate.
    <br /><br />
    Small business owners know that to
    survive they must be better than the
    competition that often surrounds them.
    Since they carefully choose their
    merchandise and keep a smaller inventory,
    they often can�t offer the cut-rate prices
    that some bigger chain stores can.
    <br /><br />
    However, they more than make up for this
    in customer service and quality of the
    items. Plus, let�s face it; some of these small
    stores have a charm and personality that
    cannot be matched.
    <br /><br />
    So, next time you think of heading to
    one of those large impersonal box stores,
    head into town instead to check out what
    you can find. You will be pleasantly
    surprised and I�m sure go back again and
    again. After all, you can�t beat the
    convenience of shopping close to home,
    and strolling around downtown can be
    much more pleasant than fighting the
    crowds at the mall.
    <br /><br />
    When you do patronize these
    businesses, and find yourself pleased with
    the service, make sure to tell others in
    person and on social media. These local
    shop owners rely not only on the
    advertising they do or community
    participation, but their reputation is always
    at the forefront of their success! So, spread
    the word, and make your downtown a
    bustling and successful part of your
    community.
