    (NAPS)—Since it’s hard to enjoy the outdoors if you can’t start your car, boat, motorcycle or all-terrain vehicle (ATV), choosing the right kind of battery designed for your vehicle make, model and usage habits is very important.
    <br /><br />
    These tips can help.
    <br /><br />
    <b>Automotive batteries</b><br /><br />
    It’s important to understand the tests used to measure battery performance. The two most common are cold cranking amps (CCA) and reserve capacity (RC).
    <br /><br />
    CCA measures the number of amps a battery can deliver for 30 seconds at 0° F. This is a useful comparison-shopping tool because it’s performed the same way by every manufacturer.
    <br /><br />
    RC measures the number of minutes a battery can withstand a continuous draw of 25 amps. Today’s vehicles have more onboard and consumer-installed electronics than ever before, and many systems require constant power even when the engine isn’t running.
    <br /><br />
    Frequent, short trips also increase the need for additional reserve capacity because the battery may not have enough time to recharge between stops and starts.
    <br /><br />
    Results of both tests can be found on the battery or online. Check your owner’s manual to find the right specifications for your vehicle.
    <br /><br />
    <b>Motorcycle and ATV batteries</b><br /><br />
    The most common powersport batteries are conventional lead-acid batteries and absorbed glass mat (AGM) batteries, also called maintenance-free batteries.
    <br /><br />
    While conventional lead-acid batteries are typically less expensive, they require more routine maintenance. Users must visually check the electrolyte level through the opaque white case of the battery. If the level is low, it must be refilled with distilled water to keep up performance and avoid an explosion.
    <br /><br />
    AGM batteries are more expensive but need less maintenance and perform well in extreme climates.
    <br /><br />
    Conventional and AGM powersport batteries come with acid bottles for filling the batteries. A motorcycle battery charger should be used to activate these batteries once filled.
    <br /><br />
    <b>Marine batteries</b><br /><br />
    Marine batteries are different from car batteries. A marine battery needs to crank over an engine and supply the energy needed for continued accessory use.
    <br /><br />
    For that, marine starting batteries—also known as cranking batteries—are a good fit.
    <br /><br />
    If you need to power many electronic devices, such as trolling motors, GPS or fish finders, a deep cycle battery can be better.
