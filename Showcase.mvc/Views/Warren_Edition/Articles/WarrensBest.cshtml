    It was a magical evening in Warren, New Jersey, as Wear
    the Cape and the kidkind Foundation hosted its fourth annual
    holiday fundraiser. What Founder Leigh Ann Errico
    started as a Christmas cookie exchange in a small dorm room
    over 20 years ago with only a handful of friends has evolved
    into a spectacular night every year, with almost 100 women
    and children gathering to support and celebrate the works
    of Wear the Cape and the kidkind Foundation.
    <br /><br />
    Some of the original attendees joined the event this
    evening, including Cynthia Caramico, who gave a passionate
    testimonial on Wear the Cape’s elementary school Hero Assembly.
    e program reached thousands of kids this year
    through over 30 performances since its launch less than a
    year ago. Guests got a taste of the interactive assembly by
    watching a highlight video featuring real kids who acted in
    the assembly to spread kindness and encouragement in the
    fight against bullying. All were inspired and agreed that the
    program’s focus on courage and kindness, delivered through
    relatable messages, is a must for all schools.
    <br /><br />
    Over 20 young children, ranging in age from four to
    16, volunteered to help at the event. These Cape Kids greeted
    guests with big smiles and huge hearts, as they collected toy
    donations for underprivileged children via New Jersey Children’s
    Shelter of Trenton, and much needed supplies for our
    troops overseas via Operation NJ Cares. YLP Parking of Kenilworth,
    New Jersey donated their valet fee, as a way to
    honor all veterans and “pay it forward.”
    <br /><br />
    Coming together to toast to kindness and commemorate
    the achievements of the past year was a highlight of the
    evening. In addition to launching and performing Hero Assemblies,
    a number of which were donated, these accomplishments
    include being chosen to present at the NJASEC
    Convention at Rider University in Lawrenceville, NJ; developing
    Cape South, a branch of Wear the Cape assemblies in
    Florida; and the creation of its first children’s book, titled
    IT’S GOOD TO BE KINGD, which kidkind Foundation
    will be donating to underprivileged kindergarten classrooms
    and Wear the Cape will be selling starting at the beginning
    of 2017.
    <br /><br />
    Adorable Cape Kids modeled Wear the Cape’s newest
    merchandise: the cozy, embroidered Wear the Cape Hero
    Hat – White Winter Edition and the Cup of Kindness Mug,
    which joined the long list of Better an at™ items, such
    as lip balm, T-shirts, baseball caps, and even beach balls!
    <br /><br />
    Madame Hollis provided guests with kindness fortune
    readings on the lower level of the event, while the talented
    Will Honicky, a high school student from Morris Plains, and
    Chris Waryn of Watchung entertained guests with their
    beautiful melodies on the piano.
    <br /><br />
    It was an evening of sheer enjoyment. And when the
    night came to an end, guests left with dozens of cookies to
    share in their own homes for the holidays.
    <br /><br />
    After 20 years, the cookie swap tradition continues –
    only now guests are exchanging more than cookies. ey
    share kindness, generosity, goodwill, and hope for a brighter,
    kinder world, for their families and children around the
    world.
    <br /><br />
