    Tree Owners Need To Take Action
</div>
<br><br />
    Our suburban forest and landscape has had a lot to deal with from Hurricane Irene, the unexpected Halloween snowstorm, superstore Sandy, a severe winter and the recent summer drought. This displays the dynamic ever changing nature of our environment. Yes, nature can and will care for itself in wilderness settings, however, that changes as man enters the picture.
    <br /><br />
    When trees are in close proximity to our homes and landscapes are nurtured for our benefit, they need our assessment and care. Although often taken for granted, we all need to be aware of the many attributes of plants. Needing assurance, tree owners need to take Action to reduce and remediate potential problems and hazards. An experienced and qualified arborist is capable and equipped to provide this reassurance.
    <br /><br />
    Fall and winter offer the most opportune time to assess your trees and landscapes. Whether it�s for safety pruning, formative pruning, or creating a Plant Health Care Program the dormant season is the time to take action.
    <br /><br />
    The faster action is taken, the better the results. In the past few years two devastating problems have made their way to our backyards, the Emerald Ash Borer (EAB) and Bacterial Leaf Scorch (BLS). These problems can be crippling and deadly to our trees and need to be properly treated as soon as possible.
    <br /><br />
    EAB made its first appearance in the southeastern Michigan area near Detroit in 2002. Since its discovery, this insect has killed over 20 million Ash trees on its path to the beautiful Garden State. Once the borer enters an area and starts breeding, the population steadily grows. If one female lays her typical 75 to 90 eggs, having a 90% survival rate, in four years that one Ash tree will support a population of 5,120,000 Emerald Ash Borers. Once infected, the death rate for an Ash tree is roughly 99.8%. These numbers are overwhelming on just a single property, knowing that EAB is now active in 25 states and 2 Canadian Provinces, is discouraging for the future of Ash trees.
    <br /><br />
    Bacterial Leaf Scorch is a destructive disease that affects many shade trees. BLS is caused by a Xylem-inhibiting bacterium which inhibits the conduction of nutrients from the leaves to the stems, causing die back and eventual death. This is a slow death for any tree that has been affected. There are no cures for the disease but with proper planning, maintenance, and treatment, trees can maintain themselves for years. In New Jersey 39% of Oaks have been infected, this disease, however, isn�t limited to Oaks; it can also infect American Elm, Maple, Sycamore, Mulberry, and Sweet Gum.
    <br /><br />
    The natural characteristic and dynamic of our woody landscape is always changing whether from diseases, pests, extreme storms and/or drought. Though this is a tremendous natural challenge, professional diagnosis will provide a greater understanding to the attention and treatments your property needs. Whether inspecting and preventing hazards, treating, or fertilizing, action is necessary for the survival and well-being of the trees and plants in our suburban landscape. The health and well-being of our trees is important now and for the future of the environment and community.
