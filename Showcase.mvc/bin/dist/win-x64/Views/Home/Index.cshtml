                </div>
                <br /><br />
                <div class="article-text">
                    On May 4-6, more than 1,500 spectators flocked to the New Jersey Wine and Food Festival at Sussex County’s Crystal Springs Resort. They came to taste the best in award-winning cuisine, and in the middle of it all they found Joe Gramaglia, owner and Executive Chef at Warren’s own Saly Gs Restaurant and Tavern!
                    <br /><br />
                    “This was a tremendous opportunity for me as a chef, and as someone who never had formal culinary training,” Joe says. “I got to work alongside some of the best chefs in the world. What an inspiration to watch them work – it really reinforces the idea that as chefs, we’re always learning and there are always new things to try.”

                <div class="article-text">
                    Now that we finally are defrosted from months of living under the snow, it’s time to start planning all the wonderful ways to get outdoors again. One option is through a wine tour! Pair Wine Tours offers three New York City neighborhood wine tours with options located in Hell’s Kitchen, The Lower East Side or Hoboken. Guests will visit two restaurants and one wine shop while enjoying delicious bites and learning everything you’d ever wanted to know about wine from a hands-on sommelier! 
                    <br /><br />
                    Pair Wine Tours was created by Wine Ambassador Keir Carter. He's worked under accomplished chefs such as Bobby Flay and was also responsible for opening and training all the front of the house staff at Justin Timberlake's Southern Hospitality BBQ. Carter is now passionate about sharing food and wine pairing at various locations throughout the city. He says his tours are, "Wine school for people who prefer class trips!"
