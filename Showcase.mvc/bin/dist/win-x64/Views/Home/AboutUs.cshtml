            <br><br />
            <b>The Showcase Magazine</b> was established in 1996 for the purpose of promoting the businesses in Warren and the surrounding areas. We encourage consumers to look within their own community for all of their business and shopping needs. <b>The Showcase</b> offers the community a professional magazine with informative columns, community news, community calendars, articles on area businesses as well as a beautiful front cover which features local and country-wide artists.
            <br><br>
            <b>The Showcase Magazine</b> strives to provide advertisers with the best publication in the area. We offer all our clients professional and personal attention from the initial sale to the finished product. No client is too small or large and we provide the same quality product and individual attention to all accounts.
            <br><br>
            <b>The Showcase Magazine</b> is proud to be celebrating its 22nd year serving the Warren/Watchung area as well as Stirling, Gillette, Millington, Berkeley Heights, New Providence, Martinsville, Green Brook and Basking Ridge.
            <br><br>
            <b>The Showcase Magazine,</b> 22 years later, continues to be committed to giving back to the community.  We take pride in having partnered with the WBPA in years past and have donated over $100,000 since 1996 by supporting area schools, sports programs, civic groups, and numerous charitable associations. We are not just a business, but a family living in this community we call home.
            <br><br>
