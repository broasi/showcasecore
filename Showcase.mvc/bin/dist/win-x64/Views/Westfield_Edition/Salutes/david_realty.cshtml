                If you�re in the market to sell your home, wouldn�t you want to receive outstanding Customer Service, enjoy a smooth, hassle-free transaction, and save money at the same time?  If you think that sounds too good to be true, you should get to know David Realty Group in Westfield.  David and Lorena Barbosa lead an independent team of more than 30 experienced Realtors helping buyers and sellers across the area realize their real estate dreams � all with a local touch you can�t find anywhere else!
                <br><br>
                David Realty Group is proud to be able to sell homes in the area for only 4.5 percent on a full service listing agreement � no easy feat in today�s competitive market.  But because the Barbosas' team isn�t owned by a franchise company or large corporation, they're able to pass those savings directly on to their clients.
                <br><br>
                �When you work with us, you�re going to experience phenomenal service � AND you�re going to save money,� David says.  �You don�t have to be a national brand to give the best service to your clients � we work hard at building relationships, at truly helping people find the right home for them when they�re buying, and at maximizing their return when selling.
                <br><br>
                �We do all the legwork,� he adds.  �And we make it smooth from start to finish.  We have in-house mortgage professionals, appraisers, professional photographers, inspectors, stagers and attorneys � everything�s taken care of from A to Z.�
                <br><br>
                Prior to opening David Realty Group in 2011, David owned a real estate agency in Jersey City.  He saw a trend where many families were looking to get out of the city and into communities like Westfield � �emigrating,� he explains � and realized they needed someone on the other end who could specifically tend to their needs relocating to the suburbs.  Often when homebuyers are looking to move away from the commotion of places like Jersey City and Hoboken, it�s David Realty Group they turn to.
                <br><br>
                �Towns like Westfield, Cranford, Scotch Plains, and the surrounding areas are �hot,� desirable places to live,� he says.  �Close enough that people moving here can still commute to work in the city, but also enjoy everything that comes with suburban living at the same time.  Lorena and I are long-time members of the community.  Our agents are entrenched here, and we�re able to really provide outstanding, personalized local service because we have that connection.�
                <br><br>
                David�s close-knit group provides boutique services and embraces current technology driving the real estate industry, helping buyers and sellers harness the information available to them to make the best-informed decisions possible.  With the sheer volume of data available to people on both sides of a real estate transaction, information overload can sometimes set in � or people can fall victim to outdated or simply wrong information they find online. The best information, David says, is at the fingertips of professional Realtors.
                <br><br>
                David Realty Group puts that technology to work in a number of ways, including the development of online virtual tours, and by executing integrated social media and e-mail campaigns to prospective buyers and sellers.  It�s all part of a marketing plan designed to provide maximum exposure for your home.  David Realty Group�s properties are given syndicated listings on more than 50 domestic websites such as Trulia, Zillow, and Realtor.com, along with more than 20 international sites.  And with all of this comes a philosophy of providing 24/7 customer service.
