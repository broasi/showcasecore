    Five For the Sky:  Load These Onto Your Next In-Flight Playlist

    If you�ve got kids, there�s probably just one thing that�s on your mind now that we�re in September: back to school!  Summer vacation is over, and we�re back to the routine of homework, school lunches, soccer practice, and PTA meetings.  But maybe it also means it�s time to plan what you might be doing over school breaks � or even starting to think ahead to next summer.  (After all, the kids probably are!)
    <br><br>
    If you find yourself booking plane tickets for your next trip, and if you�re like me and don�t leave the in-flight music selection to chance with the pre-programmed entertainment systems, here are five tracks to help kick start a playlist that�s right at home 30,000 feet in the air:
    <br><br>
    �In the Light,� Led Zeppelin:  Full disclosure � this song gets the top spot on my list because on my first trip to my wife�s home country of Chile, it was in my headphones when the sunrise started breaking over the Andes Mountains as we flew in.  That anecdote aside, this majestic musical journey is the opening song from the second record of Zeppelin�s �Physical Graffiti� album � and a heavy synthetic bassline coupled with the hard-hitting force of John Bonham�s steady pounding are perfect complements to Robert Plant�s vocals about never feeling alone.  The lyrics are largely forgettable, but just relax and let the sound carry you to your destination.
    <br><br>
    �Red House,� Jimi Hendrix:  Electric blues at its most electric.  Hendrix cuts searing guitar work through a slow, mellow dirge in the style of the classic Chicago bluesmen.  A perfect song for gazing out of an airplane window at the earth (or clouds) down below.
    <br><br>
    �Only Dreaming,� Maids of Gravity:  If you�ve never heard of Maids of Gravity, you�re not alone.  Their self-titled 1995 album is the only one they ever dropped, and the only single to gain even modest airplay was �Only Dreaming.�  A looping synth-enhanced guitar riff prods this grinding track through five Spacehog-ish minutes.
    <br><br>
    �Get It Together,� Beastie Boys:  This single off the 1994 classic �Ill Communication� album features guesting vocals from Q-Tip of Tribe Called Quest.  (And, for the curious, holds the lyric that gives the album its name.)  If you hear something that sounds like �Age of Aquarius� hidden in the music, that�s the Moog Machine�s cover version from 1969�s �Switched-On Rock� experiment.  On an album boasting hip-hop staples like �Sure Shot� and �Root Down,� not to mention the onslaught of �Sabotage,� �Get It Together� played as a nice, easy interlude � and plays nicely any time you�ve reached cruising altitude with the seat back and your eyes closed.
    <br><br>
    �Time to Pretend,� MGMT:  This track might have been overshadowed by �Kids� from MGMT�s 2008 release, �Oracular Spectacular,� but it holds its own as some of the best songwriting from the late 2000s.  It�s a shame more people haven�t paid attention to MGMT � and this soaring track, which feels more like a space flight than a plane ride, is a prime example of what you�re missing if you haven�t already tuned in.
