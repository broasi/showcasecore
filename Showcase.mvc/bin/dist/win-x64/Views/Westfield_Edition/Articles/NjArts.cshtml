        FRESH PICKINGS
        <br /><br />
        The 2015-2016 Theatre Season Begins with NJ Premieres

    Being on a perpetual school calendar, I�ve always thought the New Year should be marked right after Labor Day, summer�s unofficial conclusion. Everything starts up again, and as the weather cools the autumn provides a climate that makes the world feel fresh.
    <br /><br />
    Our theatres continue the tradition of beginning their seasons in the fall, which is another reason I think the January 1st holiday is misplaced. This time, the sense of newness will be enhanced by many titles making their New Jersey debuts.
    <br /><br />
    The Paper Mill Playhouse, NJ�s official theatre, is actually offering a world premiere, a new musical called THE BANDSTAND, October 8 through November 8. Last fall it created lots of buzz after a reading in New York, and the Millburn stage will be the first to give it life. Set in the days right after World War II, it tells the story of a band of battle-scarred musicians who enter a contest sponsored by a radio network. The goal is to find the best new song to welcome the troops home, with the winner being showcased on a live feed from Rockefeller Center. NY Post columnist Michael Riedel is so high on the piece, he�s already predicting a Broadway transfer and the Tony Award for Best Musical.
    <br /><br />
    (He�s wrong. I think the current smash HAMILTON will be crowned next June.)
    <br /><br />
    As regular readers know, I�m also a history buff. Hence, I�m very keen to see George Street Playhouse�s production of THE SECOND MRS. WILSON, running November 10 through the 29th. It will put the spotlight on Edith Galt, who snared widower Woodrow Wilson (the only Jersey boy ever elected to the White House) in 1915. After his paralyzing stroke four years later, she became the first de facto female president, given her concealment of how seriously ill he was, and her assumption of his duties. At least that�s how most historians see it�sorry Hillary.
    <br /><br />
    The show received a handsome, well-reviewed production this May at Connecticut�s Long Wharf Theatre, one of the nation�s most respected regional houses, and may also be destined for New York. (Seeing future Broadway shows for a great deal less money is one of the best perks of living here.)  Joe DiPietro, another NJ native, has seen several of his other scripts (like I LOVE YOU, YOU�RE PERFECT, NOW CHANGE) bloom on a local stage and then conquer Manhattan.
    <br /><br />
    The Shakespeare Theatre of New Jersey will bow with EQUIVOCATION, September 16 through October 4th. It sounds similar to WITTENBERG, their hit spoof from last season. Like that play, it�s a mash-up of historical events and what-ifs, with an additional roman a clef element. In this case, Britain�s King James commissions �William Shakespeare� to write about the infamous Gunpowder Plot, a real conspiracy to blow up the House of Lords in 1605.
    <br /><br />
    The ever-innovative, cutting edge company Luna Stage will present THE TALL GIRLS, October 8 through the first of November. The description they�ve put out refers to a 1930s Dust Bowl setting (the appropriately-named town of Poor Prairie), where not much happens and visitors are about as rare as hen�s teeth. One day, a man climbs off a train, carrying the only inflated basketball within city limits. The publicity adds that the play �explores class, gender and the history of women in sports,� so perhaps in the wake of the U.S. Women�s Soccer Team�s victory, this will be a timely offering.
