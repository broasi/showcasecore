    THE SUDDEN SUMMIT<br /><br />
    When the Cold War Thawed in Glassboro
</div><br> <br />

    In late June of 1967, the eyes of the world were focused on a sleepy college campus in southern New Jersey.
    <br /><br />
    While war raged around the globe, the leaders of the world�s greatest superpowers met on the campus of Rowan University, which may be the country�s most re-named school. Then called Glassboro State and little known outside of our borders, President Lyndon Johnson conferred with Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin there for three days.
    <br /><br />
    Such conferences were much rarer then, and as America and Russia were avowed enemies with brimming nuclear stockpiles, the stakes were high. While nothing like a diplomatic breakthrough occurred, the simple fact that the two rivals met was huge news, and the event did improve relations�for awhile. That alone was worth the effort.
    <br /><br />
    And to think it all began over a century earlier, in a factory.

    In 1838, a man named T. H. Whitney consolidated several glassmaking operations in Gloucester County and incorporated under the family moniker. His sons Thomas and Samuel joined him, and eventually the Whitney Brothers became the dominant glass manufacturer in the state.
    <br /><br />
    You can guess how the town they also developed got its name.
    <br /><br />
    By the late 1840s, Tom left the daily operations to Sam and went into politics. He served two terms in the state legislature and became a philanthropist. In 1849 the clearly-restless Tom returned from a European tour and bought 100 acres in Glassboro. There he built a grand mansion in 1850.
    <br /><br />
    Flash ahead to the twentieth century.
    <br /><br />
    During the first two decades, there was a serious teacher shortage in New Jersey. The main reason was the lack of proper training, especially in the southern half. Hence, on the brink of the First World War, Trenton decided to found a two-year teacher�s college.
    <br /><br />
    Several South Jersey towns competed for the project, knowing it would confer status and jobs to the winner. In 1917, Glassboro residents raised the then-hefty sum of $7000 to purchase a quarter of the Whitney estate, including the family home. To sway the search committee, they offered the parcel for free if their hamlet was chosen.
    <br /><br />
    This gesture, along with Glassboro�s strategic location (south of the state capital, near Philadelphia), superior train service, a nice balance of manufacturing and farming and lovely topography, sealed the deal.
    <br /><br />
    The Glassboro Normal School opened in 1923. It was an immediate success, and by 1934 things expanded to a four-year program. In 1937, its name was changed to the New Jersey State Teacher�s College. By the 1950s, with other academic departments added, it changed again to Glassboro State, its title in 1967.
    <br /><br />
    But how was it chosen for such a momentous occasion? Again, its place on the map proved advantageous.
    <br /><br />
    On June 5th, the famous Six Day War broke out between Israel and her Arab �neighbors.� (My, how things haven�t changed.) Oddly, this led to a more open dialogue and even some cooperation between the White House and the Kremlin.
    <br /><br />
    With the United Nations somewhat more relevant back then, the Russians sent Kosygin to address the General Assembly about the mid-east crisis. Viet Nam was reaching its nasty peak, and American officials saw an opportunity to discuss both proxy wars and other issues in a summit setting.
    <br /><br />
    Each side was willing, but Kosygin wanted to talk in New York. LBJ feared street protestors, and tried to coax him to Washington. When the former demurred, Johnson asked then NJ Governor Richard Hughes to suggest a place equidistant between the two.
    <br /><br />
    Hughes picked Glassboro.
    <br /><br />
    Once the compromise was made, the school had only 16 hours� notice to make preparations. Today, such an arrangement would probably take 16 weeks!
    <br /><br />
    The Whitney mansion, now called Hollybush and functioning as the college president�s home, became the confab�s headquarters. Johnson and Kosygin used the library, while their ministers huddled in the living room.
    <br /><br />
    The summit�s best legacy was the cordiality the parties enjoyed. The President and the Premier truly hit it off, with Johnson actually labeling the Russian �jolly.� Hoping that relations might continue to improve, he referred to �the spirit of Hollybush� in subsequent months.
    <br /><br />
    Today, the meeting is largely forgotten and the school has undergone yet another name change: in the 90�s a benefactor�s huge donation re-christened the place Rowan University.
    <br /><br />
    But for a few days 48 years ago, Glassboro was a figurative world capital.
