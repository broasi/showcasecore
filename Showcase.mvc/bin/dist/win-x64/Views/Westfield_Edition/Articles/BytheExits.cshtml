    This year, �By the Exits� is going county-by-county around New Jersey�s 170 miles of shoreline, helping you find some hidden gems that can add a little something extra to your next beach-bound road trip.  In this issue, explore a few Atlantic County spots beyond the gambling capital we all know and (mostly) love:

    <b>Exit 48, Galloway Township.</b>  One of the greatest examples of the contract between the bright lights and natural beauty of New Jersey�s shoreline can be found at the Edwin Forsythe Wildlife Management Area across Reeds Bay/Absecon Bay from Atlantic City.  Here you can stand, or boat, in near silence, enjoying the serenity of the wetlands and inlets while the neon glow of the East Coast gaming capital warms the horizon to the southeast.  It�s a reminder that as loud, brash, and �Jersey� as the Jersey shore can be, there�s plenty of �other� Jersey just west of the Garden State Parkway.
    <br /><br />
    <b>Exit 40, Brigantine.</b>  If you�ve got an interest in the Lenni Lenape tribes that once made southern New Jersey their home, or if you want to learn about the �Atlantis of New Jersey,� it�s worth planning a stop at the Brigantine Historical Museum on Brigantine Blvd.  Once a vibrant, burgeoning shore community, Mother Nature gradually chipped away through a series of nor�easters and hurricanes that overwhelmed the barrier island block-by-block and building-by-building.  Much of old Brigantine is now underwater (although some of it has been known to wash up on shore from time to time).  Right next door to the museum, which holds a detailed history of what Brigantine used to be, is the Marine Mammal Stranding Center � a unique facility dedicated to rescuing and relocated beached marine life like dolphins, whales, seals and sea turtles.  It�s open to the public Tuesday � Sunday, and you�re even given the chance to adopt a seal!
    <br /><br />
    <b>Exit 36, Margate.</b>  Margate�s most famous former hotel/pachyderm just turned 134 this year!  Don�t already know the story of how Lucy the Elephant first came to grace the beach at Margate?  Learn the history of this classic piece of Jerseyana at www.lucytheelephant.org  and start planning a visit � she�s just a few minutes from Atlantic City�s Boardwalk!
    <br /><br />
    <b>Exit 30, Somers Point.</b>  Why is Somers Mansion on this list?  It�s doesn�t house a museum, or open out onto a Boardwalk, or offer opportunities to get up close and personal with Atlantic County�s diverse marshland wildlife.  It�s here because a) it�s an indelible part of southern New Jersey history, b) introduces visitors to the story of a Jersey-born war hero, and c) is free to visit!  Commodore Richard Somers attempting a daring rescue at sea during the Barbary pirate battles of the early 19th century.  Somers and a small band of troops sailed a tiny skiff loaded with gunpowder into Tripoli Harbor in a plot to free an American crew held hostage on a boat captured by the pirates � and if you want to know how this story ends, stop in at the Atlantic County Historical Museum just down the block after visiting the mansion!

    Coming in the next issue, �By the Exits� wraps up 2015 in the best �Jersey Shore� spot to celebrate the holidays � Cape May County!
