       Our car donation program was born of a single brainstorm we had back in 1994. Rather than rely on private donations and traditional fundraising methods to support our growing charity, we�d provide a public service that would send a steady stream of revenue directly to our charity programs. We also made the decision to process all car donations in house, allowing the full proceeds of each donation to go directly to our charity programs.
        <br /><br />
       Since Kars4Kids was founded in 1995<br />

       �	240,000 cars recycled<br />
       �	1,000 towers in our network
