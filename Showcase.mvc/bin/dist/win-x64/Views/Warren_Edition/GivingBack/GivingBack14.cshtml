       At Hungry for Music, our most important service is putting musical instruments into hungry hands. We serve children who demonstrate a desire to learn music, as well as teachers who have students willing to learn. Music has the ability to heal; it soothes tension and can transform sadness and aggression into hope and creativity. Music is the prayer through which the world heals itself.
       <br /><br />
       We believe that by sharing instruments and musical experiences, children who would not normally have the opportunity can experience a kind of freedom and self-discovery that is often stifled in an atmosphere of economic hardship. All of our events, benefits, instrument drives, & CD production are aimed at uplifting those lives and enriching culture at-large by supporting the availability of music education.
