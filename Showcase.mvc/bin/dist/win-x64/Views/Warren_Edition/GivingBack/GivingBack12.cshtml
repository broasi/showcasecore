       <b>The Facts About Hunger</b>
       <br /><br />
       1 in 5 kids in America doesn't get the food they need every day. This takes a terrible toll on their health and development, and threatens their futures in profound ways. It also drags down our nation's economy by perpetuating the cycle of poverty.
       <br /><br />
       Childhood hunger is a problem that threatens our children and our future. We're in danger of losing an entire generation of leaders, innovators and problem-solvers. But we are ending childhood hunger today.
       <br /><br />
       With your support, No Kid Hungry works to ensure that every child in the United States has access to healthy food where they live, where they learn and where they play. Read about the amazing true success stories at <a href="http://www.nokidhungry.org" target="_blank">www.nokidhungry.org</a>

       <br /><br />
       Reach Out and Read is a nonprofit organization that gives young children a foundation for success by incorporating books into pediatric care and encouraging families to read aloud together.
       <br /><br />
       Reach Out and Read was founded in 1989 with its first program at Boston City Hospital (now Boston Medical Center). By 2001, dramatic growth brought the Reach Out and Read model to all 50 states, with almost 1,500 sites distributing 1.6 million books per year.
       <br /><br />
       Today, Reach Out and Read partners with more than 5,500 program sites and distributes 6.5 million books per year. The program currently serves one in five children living in poverty in this country, and continues to grow each year with the vision that one day the Reach Out and Read model will be a part of every young child's checkups.
