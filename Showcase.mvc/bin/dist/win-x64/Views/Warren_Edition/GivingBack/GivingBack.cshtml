    Kids Wish Network has been making dreams come true for hundreds of thousands of children all over the world since 1997. We are dedicated to infusing hope, creating happy memories, and improving the quality of life for children who are experiencing life-altering situations.
    <br /><br />
    We started with the single purpose of granting wishes to children suffering with life-threatening conditions, but have since created additional programs to benefit kids worldwide, including Hero of the Month, Kids Wish Network On Tour, Holiday of Hope Gift Banks, A Child Forever Funeral Assistance, and our International Relief program.
    <br /><br />
    Each and every day, we are moved by the incredible stories of children worldwide who are dealing with life-threatening illnesses, the effects of poverty, abuse or homelessness. Although they come from diverse backgrounds and circumstances, all of these children share one thing: they have faced remarkable challenges in their young lives and are in desperate need of hope.
    <br /><br />
    Our dedication and commitment to our children is what drives us to continue to grow and expand. It is our promise to continue to bring much-needed joy to these brave young hearts through our unique programs and services and bring them the hope and comfort they truly deserve.
