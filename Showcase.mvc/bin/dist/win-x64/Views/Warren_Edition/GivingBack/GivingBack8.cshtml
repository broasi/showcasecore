       A child's first five years are the key to the rest of their lives � it's when the foundation for future development is set. That's why ChildFund works to strengthen families and communities to meet children's needs and rights from the beginning and throughout their lives: education, health, nutrition, safety, employability and more.
       <br /><br />
       Helping children in poverty has always been at our heart, although how we do it has changed over time. What�s been consistent is our desire to ever improve how we make an impact � we�ve fostered a spirit of innovation from the beginning, first as China's Children Fund, then as Christian Children�s Fund and now as ChildFund International.
