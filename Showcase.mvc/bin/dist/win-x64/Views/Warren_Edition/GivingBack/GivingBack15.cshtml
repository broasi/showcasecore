       Home for Good Dog Rescue (HFGDR) is a 100% foster-based, non-profit 501(c)(3) dog rescue established in 2010 in Summit, New Jersey with offices in Berkeley Heights, New Jersey. We rescue homeless dogs from high-kill shelters in the South, which are overflowing with unwanted dogs on the brink of being euthanized. We socialize, care for, and provide them life-saving medical care at our property in Aiken, SC, transport them to our rescue in New Jersey, nurture them in our network of foster families while they await adoption into loving homes � giving them a second chance at life.

       Our Mission:<br />
       Operation Jersey Cares is comprised of Veterans and other proud Americans. We are all dedicated volunteers who give freely of our time and talents to ensure that our �Combat Veterans� are getting the support they need for the sacrifices they are making!
       <br /><br />
       Operation Jersey Cares sends packages to our men and women to let them know that �America� is behind their efforts. We will continue to do this until they can be reunited with their families and loved ones!
       <br /><br />
       Operation Jersey Cares is also dedicated to helping the wounded Marines and soldiers who have returned home to be with their families. Collections and donations of much needed items are brought to the Veterans Hospital, Lyons, NJ and to the Soldiers Home, Menlo Park, NJ. We also assist the families with the medical and financial needs that they may have.
       <br /><br />
