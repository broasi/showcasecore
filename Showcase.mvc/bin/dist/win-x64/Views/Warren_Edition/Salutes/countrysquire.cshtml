                <p>In the mood for a handcrafted burger, a fresh and tasty salad, or some Spanakopita? Or how about an Apple Turnover, Greek Rice Pudding or a slice of Chocolate Cake? The Country Squire restaurant in Warren can satisfy these cravings and more. They are open 7 days a week from 6:00 am to 9:00 pm and everything on the menu is served all day long. So, feel free to have steak and fries for breakfast and bacon and eggs for dinner. </p>
                <p>The Country Squire is a family owned business started by brothers Mike and Mino Stavrakis. They began their restaurant careers back in the 60&rsquo;s with the Venus Diner in Union, NJ. In 2008, their cousin George Pelechrinis came on as a partner. Before this restaurant, he owned the Somerset Diner in Somerset. George&rsquo;s son John Pelechrinis is the manager of the restaurant and has been working in diners with his father since the age of 10. Mike and George (Mino left in 2017) work hard to provide the best atmosphere and food for their customers and often come in around 2:00 in the morning to get ready for the day. &ldquo;These are the guys that deserve the credit for this business,&rdquo; states John. </p>

                <p>The restaurant serves Greek dishes as well as traditional diner food such as Disco Fries, Stuffed Potato Skins, Chicken Fingers, Mozzarella Sticks, French Onion Soup, Cobb Salads, Turkey Burgers, and Omelets. There is something for everyone on the menu. </p>
                <p>One of the unique things they have is the Ice Cream bar. Here, there is everything needed to make spectacular sundaes, banana splits and shakes. There are huge jars of sprinkles and other toppings available so you can order exactly what you want.</p>
                <p>The restaurant has been in Warren since 1974 (it did move a couple of doors down from its original location back in 2008) and has a true hometown feel. It doesn&rsquo;t look very big from the outside, but when you walk in you realize how far back it goes and how spacious it really is. They can seat 180 people, and the booths are large and cozy. They also have tables available as well. </p>
                <p>The Country Squire is a comfortable, inviting dining spot where 65% of their customers are regulars. &ldquo;This restaurant is a hang-out spot, the local meet and greet place,&rdquo; according to John. People like to come in to socialize and relax, and of course to eat some really good food. Families with children have been coming in for years, and when their children grew up, they come in with their families. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a staple here for 44 years,&rdquo; says John.</p>
                <p>They are on a first name basis with many of their customers and it&rsquo;s a great venue for locals and out of towners alike. They have even had some celebrities stop in over the years, including major league athletes and movie stars. The service is friendly and customer-service oriented. Many of their employees, who number about 15, have been with them from day one and their turnover rate is very low. The owners, manager, and employees are dedicated to what they do, and go out of their way to make sure that all diners have a great experience each and every time. </p>
                <p>The Country Squire restaurant is located at 62 Mountain Boulevard in Warren. They can be reached at 908-561-6764. Stop in to enjoy a meal, and don&rsquo;t forget the ice cream.</p>
