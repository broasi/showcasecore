                <p>When you&rsquo;re looking to buy or sell your home, you want to work with an agent who knows more than the neighborhood &ndash; you want someone who knows the area, the market, and how to maximize your benefits on the transaction. As a 20-year resident of Basking Ridge, and a father who&rsquo;s experienced the area&rsquo;s outstanding public schools firsthand, Mark Schottenfeld is the agent to see if you&rsquo;re buying or selling in Somerset County.</p>
                <p>Mark, a Berkshire Hathaway Home Services agent who also covers much of Morris County, has one daughter who recently graduated from Ridge High School, and another entering her junior year. He&rsquo;s seen firsthand the excellence of the local school systems, which is a major draw for families looking to move into the area. With a Master&rsquo;s Degree in Real Estate Finance, he is uniquely positioned to help clients understand and navigate the complex process of buying or selling a home.</p>

                <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m proud to provide my clients with an appreciation and understanding of the Big Picture in conducting a real estate transaction,&rdquo; Mark says. &ldquo;As a graduate of New York University&rsquo;s Real Estate Institute, I&rsquo;m able to create added value for my residential clients. And as someone who&rsquo;s lived in the area for a long time, I know what a wonderful area this is to call home. I&rsquo;m excited to be able to serve the people who make up these communities.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>The communities Mark serves include Basking Ridge, Bedminster, Bernardsville, Bridgewater, Far Hills, Morristown, Peapack-Gladstone, Stirling and Warren. &ldquo;These towns have school systems that are consistently rated near the top of New Jersey&rsquo;s Public Schools,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;Graduates go on to the Ivy&rsquo;s, MIT, Amherst, and many other top universities.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>In addition to the schools, Mark cites as major draws the proximity to commuter transit lines for people who work in Manhattan, as well as the convenience of nearby highways like Routes 287 and 78. And in the bigger picture, he explains that almost anywhere you&rsquo;re looking to buy it&rsquo;s an opportune time to make the move. Rising interest rates and the potential for limits on property tax deductions can seem like challenges to new buyers, but they can also mean sellers are more motivated and eager to work with someone interested in buying.</p>
                <p>Beyond hard data about the area&rsquo;s economy and market trends, Mark&rsquo;s also a trusted resource for people new to the process who want to know what they&rsquo;re about to enter into. He&rsquo;s able to support his clients through each step of the real estate journey, going beyond the closing to make sure they&rsquo;ve gotten precisely what they wanted and needed from the transaction. He&rsquo;s proud to be a true partner to his clients, and places the highest priority on each client&rsquo;s investment.</p>
