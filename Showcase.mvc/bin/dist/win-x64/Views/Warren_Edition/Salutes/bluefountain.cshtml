                <p>Life can be stressful, and what better way to relax than with a great massage? Or, if you want to remove the signs of stress and have a vibrant look all year round, a facial can help you achieve a healthy-looking complexion.</p>
                <p>Both of these services and more are available at Blue Fountain Day Spa in Green Brook, which opened in October of 2016. The manager, Lin Shen, is very knowledgeable about the body and believes that massages and facials not only help you feel and look better, but can also improve your overall well-being. She owned a spa in China for 15 years, and Chinese medicine is the foundation of what she practices. When she started working in spas in the United States 4 &frac12; years ago, she brought these skills with her. Lin has been with Blue Fountain Day Spa since the day it opened, and she trains all the staff to ensure that they are following the practices she believes work the best. </p>

                  <p>Blue Fountain Day Spa offers many different types of massages, from Deep Tissue and Swedish to Hot Stone and Acupressure, as well as those tailored to specific parts of the body. However, Lin likes to focus the most on Meridian Massage. As explained on their website, Meridian &ldquo;stimulates the main and collateral channels of moral integrity, removes toxins, smooths the body&rsquo;s <strong>qi</strong>&nbsp;(pronounced chee) life force and blood flow, and eliminates symptoms; all so as to regulate the body with the purpose of preventing disease.&rdquo; Lin related stories about people who were ill with different medical problems, and after a course of these massages, had a better quality of life. For example, her clients with sciatica, which is a painful nerve condition that runs down the back of the leg, have shown remarkable improvement in mobility. She is also a big advocate of Moxibustion therapy, which she says can prevent and treat diseases using heat stimulation on acupoints in the body. Lin believes that the correct massage therapy to the specific problem area can alleviate symptoms without pills or surgery. </p>
                <p>Besides massages, Blue Fountain Day Spa also offers a variety of facials. According to their website, &ldquo;Tailored to your skin condition, our facial treatments utilize the right products and techniques to not only cleanse and freshen your skin, but to also tone your facial muscles, soften fine wrinkle lines, and renew innate vitality!&rdquo; There are Express Facials, for those who don&rsquo;t have a lot of time to spend in the spa, as well as Deep Cleansing, Classic, Back Facial, and more. Their Age Defying Facial is popular with clients looking to make their wrinkles appear less noticeable and to firm up sagging skin. As Lin mentions, &ldquo;these facials stimulate the blood circulation and help tighten up the collagen so the face looks younger.&rdquo; </p>
                <p>The spa also offers Body Scrubs. As stated on their website, &ldquo;Whether through our Aromatherapy Body Scrub or our unique&nbsp;granulated sugar and essential oil Body Scrub, your skin will&nbsp;feel smooth and glow with vigor.&rdquo; Additionally, they offer more advanced skin services such as microdermabrasion.</p>
                <p>Lin stresses that in order for these services to have the best possible outcomes, they have to be done on a regular basis. This is why they offer packages of multi-sessions, which present the biggest discounts. </p>
