    Planning for retirement can be overwhelming.  Having the right knowledge and tools for retirement is critical to building a successful nest egg.  There are a variety of different retirement vehicles, and it is important to educate yourself on the differences between them in order to decide which one is right for you.  In this article I will outline the most common types and the advantages and disadvantages of each.
    <br /><br />
    <b>The IRA</b><br />
    IRA stands for Individual Retirement Account and can be set up at a bank or financial institution. There are several different investment options for IRAs that range from fixed income accounts to personally managed stock accounts. Money placed in an IRA account is tax deductible (Federally and in most states) for those that qualify.  For example, if someone making $80,000 contributes $5,000 to their IRA account in 2013, they will only have to reflect $75,000 of that income as taxable.  In addition, the tax on earnings on that $5,000 also gets deferred.  Once you are eligible to withdraw from your IRA, you pay taxes on the amount you distribute that year (assuming all your contributions are deductible). A key assumption for this tax strategy is that you will be making less in retirement than you are now.  Keep in mind that there are penalties for not distributing IRAs when required, and limits on contributions which may change from year to year.
    <br /><br />
    <b>The 401k</b><br />
    The most common type of retirement account is the 401k.  The main difference between an IRA and a 401k is that a 401k is usually created and maintained by your employer.  Generally, employers use a third party financial institution to invest your funds.  One of the advantages of 401ks is that they often have an option for lifecycle investments. There is a different investment mix for each decade of planned retirement.  For example, if you plan to retire in 40 years, you may place your funds in LifeCycle 2050.  This cycle would begin with an aggressive investment strategy and gradually become more conservative as time passes. The 401k investment options of 401Ks are often limited, but for the less experienced investor, it can be more comforting putting your money in the hands of an experienced professional.  One of the biggest advantages of an employer sponsored 401k program is that some companies match your contributions up to a certain percentage.  Regardless of what the matching amount is, if you work for a company that matches contributions, you should be putting in at least the maximum amount that your company will match.  Free money doesn't come around too often so if you have an opportunity as blatant as this please take it.
    <br /><br />
    <b>Roth IRA</b><br />
    My personal favorite is the Roth IRA, although there are income limitations, so not everyone qualifies.  The major difference between a Roth and a Traditional IRA is that contributions to a Roth are not tax deductible so therefore, you have to contribute to it with post tax dollars.  However, the beauty of the Roth is that when you are finally ready to retire and begin to withdraw the funds, you don't have to pay taxes on any of it.  That means your financial gains are never taxed!  The next best thing to free money is tax free money.  There are few financial vehicles that enjoy this type of tax break.   The 2013 and 2014 contribution limits are the same as those of a traditional IRA, which is $5,500 ($6,500 if you are 50 or over).  Another benefit to a Roth versus a traditional IRA or a 401K is that there are no requirements for distributions once you reach a certain age.  Key note here is that you should start contributing to your Roth before you become a big shot and exceed the income limitations.
    <br /><br />
    <b>Roth 401k</b><br />
    A Roth 401k is very similar to a Roth IRA but is employer sponsored.  The Roth 401k contribution has the same limit as the 401k plan.
    <br /><br />
    <b>Conclusion</b><br />
    The common link between all of these retirement accounts is that they offer a great tax benefit.  If you have an employer who will contribute to your 401k fund, I recommend contributing the maximum amount that the employer will match.  After that, if you can afford it and are eligible, put as much as you can toward the Roth IRA.  Don�t wait to start saving.
