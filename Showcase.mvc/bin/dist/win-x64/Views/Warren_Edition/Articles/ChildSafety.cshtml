    (NAPS)—The American Cleaning Institute (ACI) is joining the Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association (JPMA) in their observance of Baby Safety Month. This month-long observance is geared toward increasing awareness of safety issues that may affect your littlest loved ones. It’s crucial to keep every room in your home safe around young children including places that often go overlooked, such as the laundry room. Babies are curious, and even at a very young age, they tend to get into things that they shouldn’t. In honor of Baby Safety Month, we’re sharing three easy steps that can help keep your youngsters safe from the potential dangers hidden in the laundry room.
    <br><br>    
      Step 1: Safely store all household cleaning products. Household cleaners contain substances that can be harmful if swallowed.  To prevent accidents involving these products, it’s important to always store these items safely up and out of reach of children. That same caution needs to be applied to liquid laundry packets. According to a recent national survey conducted by ACI, 61% of parents and caregivers are storing laundry packets in-sight or in-reach of children. Laundry packets contain highly-concentrated detergent and can cause injury if exposed to the eyes or if swallowed. Make sure these products are stored in a cabinet with a child safety lock to keep away curious little fingers. The safe storage, use and handling of all household cleaners are essential in preventing accidental exposures.

    Step 2:  Activate child lock on washer and dryer. The washer and dryer can be fascinating to young children, so it’s best to always close their doors so children won’t be tempted to play hide and seek in these appliances.  There are times when it is necessary to air out the washer, so be vigilant about keeping children out of the laundry room while the door is open. When the washer and dryer aren’t in use, activate a child lock so kids can’t start the appliance.
    <br><br>    
    Step 3: Look at the laundry room through your child’s eyes. Get down low to discover first-hand what a small child might be attracted to in your laundry space. Unusually shaped objects, interesting noises—all these things could attract a baby’s curiosity. It’s important to move all cleaning products to high shelves, remove any choking hazards, wrap electrical cords and plug all outlets.
    <br><br>    
    Remember, simple precautions can help ensure that all children have the chance to grow up in a safe home environment.
