    Erik Slagle has written the “College Bound,” “By the Exits” and “The Playlist” columns, along with dozens of Salutes, for the Showcase Magazine since 2011.  A freelance editor, copywriter, content developer, and college admissions advisor, he is also author of the “La Araucania” travel series and “The Quicksilver Sweat,” both available on Amazon Kindle.  In his spare time, he’s an SAT/ACT coach who also dabbles in screenwriting.
    <br /><br />
    Erik lives in Linden with his wife Pame, daughter Julie, and miniature poodle Leo.  He grew up in Clark and graduated from Drew University in Madison in 1998.  Every few years they can be found visiting Pame’s family in the Lake District of Chile – the setting for “La Araucania.”
    <br /><br />
    He’s been writing since he started making picture books somewhere around the first grade, and stepped into the world of test preparation 18 years ago.  In addition to the Showcase Magazine, he has also written for Edge Magazine, the Public Relations Department of a major Union County medical center, and the Marketing Department of a national career training school network.  He is the editor of “Where’s the Rest” by D.M. Nicholas and “Eat Dirt” by Katie Damiano; both titles are available in print and for Kindle.
