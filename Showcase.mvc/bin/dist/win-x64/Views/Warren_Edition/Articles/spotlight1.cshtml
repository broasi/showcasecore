    The Warren Lions Club Expo 50th Anniversary!
</div><br />

 <br /><br />
    Since 1948, the Warren Lions Club has been a vital part of the community fabric.  From assistance and guidance for neighbors experiencing vision or hearing loss, to donating Township signs and park benches, to being Warren�s largest single scholarships provider, the Lions Club carries on an important tradition of commitment to community service.  And from June 15-18, the Warren Municipal Fairgrounds will proudly host the 50th anniversary of the annual Lions Club Expo, the group�s largest fundraiser!
    <br /><br />
    Past Lions Club President and Expo Chairman Alan Kaufman of Warren is running the event for the second time.  He says this year the Lions Club is looking to scale up the event in honor of its Golden Anniversary.
    <br /><br />
    �We�re expecting more than 10,000 guests over the four days of Expo,� Alan says.  �Everything we raise will go back into the community, and we�re looking for this year�s Expo to be our biggest one yet.�
    <br /><br />
    The Expo will celebrate the Lions tradition in a family-friendly environment featuring rides, games, food, vendors and more � with a fireworks extravaganza planned for its closing night on Saturday the 18th.  And while kids and adults alike will thrill to the carnival atmosphere, the real magic will happen behind the scenes when the proceeds (and eyeglass collected at the gate) are distributed to local groups that can use the support and assistance.
    <br /><br />
    In recent years, the money raised at the Expo has helped provide full Thanksgiving meals for hundreds of township and area residents in need, and sent Watchung Hills Regional High School students to college on thousands of dollars in scholarship awards.  Other Lions Club contributions throughout the community include improvements to the 9/11 and Veterans Memorials, baseball field lighting, the playground behind the municipal building, Child Identification kits for the Watchung Police Department, and a lot more.   And of course, the clubs stays true to the Lions� original mission of working towards cures and prevention of blindness and hearing loss.
    <br /><br />
    �We work with a number of sight and hearing organizations,� Alan explains.  �The Lions Club is proud to be there to help.  If people have unresolved sight or hearing issues, we have the ability to help and to steer them towards solutions and providers whom we work with.  We�re an open ear to the community.�
    <br /><br />
    This includes helping arrange services like free eye exams in conjunction with select local and statewide providers.  Efforts like the club�s eyeglass donation boxes around town (and at the Expo � donate a pair at the gate and receive free admission for the evening!) help to fill needs that government services can�t always address.
    <br /><br />
    �The Lions Clubs is a group committed to making a difference,� Alan says.  �These are truly selfless people.  Everything is done with the community�s interest in mind, and the Club is in a position to help identify neighbors who need the kinds of assistance we can provide.�
    <br /><br />
    Even in towns like Warren and Watchung, there are families and residents who need a helping hand � even though you may not see it, says Alan:  �There are people in need, and they could be your neighbor.  You just wouldn�t know.�
    <br /><br />
    Come out from June 15-18 and support the Lions Club�s efforts, or step up and become a sponsor!  Imagine seeing the name of your business, or your family name, on a ride that will be seen by thousands of township residents!  �This is a great way to promote what you do to the entire community,� Alan says.  Alan is ready and eager to help your business gain some added visibility � don�t be surprised if he knocks on your door in the weeks ahead to talk about promoting yourself at the Expo!
    <br /><br />
    Reach out to Alan at (908) 405-1020, or call Anthony Franchini at (908) 334-9304 to become a sponsor or to find out about registering as a vendor.
    <br /><br />
    The 2015 Lions Club Expo promises to be a grand celebration marking 50 years of service and commitment � don�t miss this extraordinary event!
    <br /><br />
    �I�ve been a part of the Lions Club for a long time,� Alan says.  �Clubs like this make a community and bring it closer together.�
