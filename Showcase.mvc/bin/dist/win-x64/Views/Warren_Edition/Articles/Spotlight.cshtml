        Jimmy DeVizio
    </b>
    <br /><br />
    Jimmy has been living in Warren for almost 20 years and formerly lived in Watchung since 1964.  Jimmy is happily married to Kim for the past 5 years.
    <br /><br />
    As a Captain of the Washington Valley firehouse for the past 7 years, Jimmy was named Firefighter of the Year.  As an Elk member for the past 5 years, Jimmy was named Elk of the Year in 2012.
    <br /><br />
    When you see the banners across the roadway in town, it�s because Jimmy gets the ladder truck and hangs the banners every time. He has been doing this for several years and typically hangs 10+ banners per year.  Warren Township Recreation Commission appreciates the time Jimmy donates to help not only Recreation but the entire Township.  Warren Township is so fortunate to have people like him in this community.

    Alyssa has a phenomenal voice, stage presence and over the years has been singing at many of Recreation�s events such as the Bonfire, So You Think You Can Sing, Warren�s Got Talent and many summer concerts.
