    <b><i>Hi Sandra, <br /><br />
    We have a good size walk out basement that we would like to design for several functions but want it to feature a new large screen TV.  The space has neutral carpet and paint and recessed lights equipped with dimmers. How can we make it cozy and welcoming?

    Having your room be multi-purpose, is a good way to make the most of the space.  The traditional separate media rooms are designed with a host of specialty features such as light and sound controls, and of course the movie theater row style seating.  While this is a very luxurious feature in a home, it may not be right for everyone due to space or budget constraints.

    A room which is arranged with sofas and chairs for a more family room gathering layout will certainly be used more often day to day.  The basement can be designed with the media being the feature, while incorporating other quadrants around the room for other a bar, ping pong, billiards and even a video game area.  
    <br /><br />
    Watching a movie is possible if that portion of the room is designed with dark, warm colors and textures.  You should paint the walls of the large screen area in a very dark saturated color.  This helps with the glare and brings your visual attention to the movie. If you have space to have a few theater style recliners, it could be a fun way to have the best of both worlds.  To transition to this space you can divide the area with a bar height countertop and have bar stools behind it. A ticket booth/candy counter with a popcorn machine can be near the back and can introduce the movie area to guests.
    <br /><br />
    You could install a ceiling mounted curtain rod behind the seating   Choosing plush blackout velvety curtains, can frame the theater area much like a stage curtain. Day to day, it can be pulled back to create a visual break from the other quadrants in the room.  If privacy is needed, they can be pulled across and block out sound and light from the game area. (see photo-sterlinghomes)
    <br /><br />
    If you need more flexibility in the space, put your sofas and chairs legs on plastic furniture glides.  This way they can easy be pushed into different configurations if movie viewing is not the main event of the day.
    <br /><br />
    With wall to wall carpet, seating areas can be defined and anchored by placing a patterned area rug over your current carpet. Use a large, upholstered ottoman with storage instead of a coffee table for tucking away remote controls and board games while providing extra seating.
    <br /><br />
    These tips can even be applied if you have a large great room that is on the first floor and want to make it a great place for the family to gather.  Designing the room to flow with several functions is a good way to make the most of the floor plan real estate.  
    <br /><br />
    Until then, Iï¿½ll see you inside.
