    We all know exercise makes you healthy but it’s hard to understand the true effect it has on the body.  Imagine achieving the benefits of wisdom through experience while having the physical attributes we did when we were younger.  Being young is easy, staying young, however, is much more difficult.  People have been searching for the elusive fountain of youth since the beginning of time.  We are bombarded with suggestive advertising steering us towards magic formulas, pills, diets, etc. with promise to make you look and feel younger.  These often pricey, quick fix products try to convince the consumer there is a short cut to achieving physical youth but in the end, they cannot deliver on their promises.

    If you are truly looking to slow the aging process, then exercise is the indisputable proven path to take.  We are now just fully realizing the measurable physical benefits of exercise.  There are studies upon studies documenting the correlation of vigorous exercise with significant reduction and even the elimination of cellular breakdown (aka “Aging”) in tissues and organs throughout our body.

    Exercise should be a part of your everyday life. There are multitudes of exercise programs available to fit just about anyone ranging from aerobic workouts involving running, swimming, cycling, etc. to anaerobic workouts which focus more on resistance or weight training.  Find something fun that works for you.  Intense exercise will produce the best results. However, something is better than nothing so start somewhere, a brisk walk in the park, an easy bike ride.  Work your way into a real program, involve others to make it a social experience.  Health clubs offer varieties of group fitness classes, weight training, cardio machines, personal trainers, etc.  Whatever you decide, just get off the couch!

    I came across an article recently about mice that were genetically modified to have an accelerated aging process. The half that were subjected to intense exercise never had their hair turn grey, and maintained their muscle mass despite growing older vs. the group of mice which had no exercise. We are much more complex beings than mice, but our bodies work in a similar fashion. Be like the “Mighty Mouse”, get your body moving today and say goodbye to the aging process of tomorrow!!!
