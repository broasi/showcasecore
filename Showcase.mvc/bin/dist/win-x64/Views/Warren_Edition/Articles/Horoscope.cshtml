                Everything you have tried to accomplish last year will be completed by March regarding business projects that you worked very hard to launch. No more delays in your future! The lunar eclipse January 31,2018 unlocked the doors for you and even better, the solar eclipse on February 15,2018 will be in your sun sign Aquarius. Having your Astrological Chart would be a great gift to yourself.

   Saturn moved into your tenth house of work December 20, 2017 and in the coming three years, you will work very hard and have your strength tested in many ways. Make sure the job you are going to next will be worthy of a great effort from you and will be a setting in which you can be acknowledged for your talents.

<b>Dear Taurus (April 20 - May 20)</b><br>
This has been a hard winter for your health. Take good care of yourself. You will need to update your passport� there is foreign travel in the near future. You will be heading to a warm destination this month which you will enjoy. Last year wasn�t a great year financially but this year is looking great! If you are trying to move or update your home, you will complete that by March.

Cheer up� last year is over so let the past go. This will be a year of accomplishments for you! Don�t spread yourself thinly. Put all your energy in one area of work. It will pay off. There are some family members that are going to be visiting you in the near future for a while. You will be happy about it. There may be a new member arriving in the family!

In terms of partnerships, you will learn about the give and take necessary in a partnership and what you want to give, and what you expect to receive in return. A partnership only works if both parties live up to their promises and commit fully to the success of the partnership � energy creates more energy.

 Saturn will remain in your sixth house of your chart for three years, until December 20, 2020. During the coming months and years, you may find that projects take longer than usual to complete (Saturn slows things down) and subsequently make the project cost more money too � Keep this in mind when estimating the cost of new projects.

This will be a month of great progress, especially in terms of your career, home, and family where apparently you are making many decisions. While you might feel tense at times, most likely because you are doing so much in short order, it will feel good to be so productive.

Work is going well but you don�t feel like you are being accommodated for all your hard work. Don�t worry this will be one of your best years since 2007! There is a lot of sadness and emptiness in your love life. Follow your heart.

<b>Dear Sagittarius (Nov. 22 - Dec. 21)</b><br> 
This month will be all about money � managing it, spending it, and finding ways to make more money. You seem to want to get a head start on doing your taxes, and may be busy gathering up receipts, and organizing them before you go to your accountant. As a Sagittarian, you are happier spending your time reading and debating intellectual concepts with friends and family than on focusing on money. Yet this month, the planets are about to make you fairly obsessed with dealing with all kinds of financial matters.

You have a big month in store, one where you can finally maneuver things to suit you. It will be an extraordinary month, for many planets are lining up in your sign, dear Capricorn. The minute the month arrives, there was a full moon January 1 in Cancer, 12 degrees, lighting your house of marriage and serious commitments.

<b>Dear Pisces (Feb. 19 - March 20)</b><br>
I know you are tired of seeing surprise reverse financial news. This has been the case since Uranus first entered Aries in 2010. It�s been a long time of dealing with up and down finances, but you are coming to the end of this phase. In May 2018, Uranus will leave Aries, but in early November will retrograde back to Aries, the place that is not so good for your money matters.
