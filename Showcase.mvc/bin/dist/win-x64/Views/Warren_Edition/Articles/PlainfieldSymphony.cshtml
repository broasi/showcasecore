                Plainfield Symphony Orchestra to Launch 97th Season in October
            </div>
            <br><br /><br />
            Founded in 1919, the Plainfield Symphony Orchestra is the oldest community symphony in New Jersey.  Under the direction of Maestro Charles Prince, the 97th season will feature works from Shostakovich, Mozart, Ravel and Chopin.
            <br /><br />
            In a season of musical highlights, however, the most eagerly anticipated concert is the annual �Pops� concert.  Last year�s pops performance, �Bernstein on Broadway,� featured vocal selections from Bernstein�s Broadway hits, performed by Grammy-award winning vocal soloist Alexandra Silber and Broadway actor Will Reynolds and narrated by Jamie Bernstein, Leonard Bernstein�s daughter.
            <br /><br />
            This season�s pops concert is �Sondheim Tonight!� on November 19, 2016, with Sondheim selections performed by a quartet of well-known musical theater stars. The concert will also feature the world premiere of a Leonard Bernstein work based on themes and songs from Bernstein�s musical �On the Town.�    Charlie Harmon, a long-time associate of Leonard Bernstein, has arranged and orchestrated the piece.
            <br /><br />
            �The Plainfield Symphony Orchestra is noted for the quality of its orchestra as well as its stature as the oldest continuously operating symphony in the country,� said Peter Lomonaco, President of the Board of Directors.  �Our mission is to promote symphonic music and educate our listeners in central New Jersey and across the region.�
            <br /><br />
            With the signing of Charles Prince as musical director in 2009, a new musical era began. Prince has led a wide range of international orchestras from the Moscow Symphony to the WDR Orchestra in Cologne and Essen, Germany, as well as the Munich Philharmonic and orchestras in Switzerland, Austria, Finland and Bulgaria. He guest conducted orchestras from Portland, Oregon to Fort Worth, Texas in North America.
            <br /><br />
            As a Pops conductor, he served as Associate Conductor for the New York Pops from 1996 to 2003, leading that orchestra on numerous occasions at Carnegie Hall. Acclaimed for his operetta and theatrical performances, he has directed the Operetta Summer in Vienna for nearly a decade. A tribute to his father, Broadway director Hal Prince, was recorded with the Munich Philharmonic for a double-CD by First Night Records, London.
            <br /><br />
            In addition to serving as music director for the Plainfield Symphony Orchestra, Prince�s projects for the 2016-17 season include assisting in the revival of the New York City Opera and conducting the company�s new production of Leonard Bernstein�s �Candide� in early 2017.
            <br /><br />
            �In addition to the musical highlights, the Plainfield Symphony Orchestra offers events that are social highlights,� said Lomonaco.  �These include the Showcase, an annual black tie dinner held at a private residence each September, and after-concert events held in Plainfield�s stunning homes.�
            <br /><br />
            Plainfield�s rich stock of noted historic homes will be on display on Saturday, December 3, 2016, as the Plainfield Symphony Orchestra presents a medley of �Plainfield�s Finest Homes for the Holidays.�  The house tour will feature holiday decor from noted interior designers as well as the homeowners and will also offer a select holiday boutique in the carriage house of one of the homes on tour.
            <br /><br />
            The Plainfield Symphony Orchestra performs at Crescent Avenue Presbyterian Church in Plainfield. For more information, please visit <a href="http://www.plainfieldsymphony.org" target="_blank">www.plainfieldsymphony.org</a>.
