        Sinatra is the State�s Premiere Artist

    As regular readers will recall, I�ve been critical of the local Arts scene in recent editions. There doesn�t seem to be anything new in our theatres, concert halls or galleries. More to the point, everything has a retrograde feel, as shows, music and even exhibitions are recycled endlessly.
    <br /><br />
    Money is tight, imaginations and attention spans are shrinking and there is no mass audience any longer. Perhaps in response to the horrid election and other menaces in our world, people are seeking comfort in familiarity.
    <br /><br />
    Okay, let�s play along for a bit.
    <br /><br />
    I�ve done lists of Firsts and Jersey-Inspired Excellence in this column, and today I�d like to sort through the voluminous roster of home-grown talent and select an All-Time Artistic Champ.
    <br /><br />
    So many names come to mind, like Abbott & Costello, Frankie Valli, Sarah Vaughn, Meryl Streep, ETC. But if I have to declare just one individual the Ultimate Jersey Star, there can only be one selection:
    <br /><br />
    Francis Albert Sinatra.
    <br /><br />
    Though he�s probably more associated with Manhattan and achieved international fame, he was born, bred and started his career here.
    <br /><br />
    His mother gave birth in their Hoboken apartment on December 12th, 1915. In one of Life�s great ironies, his golden throat didn�t make a sound after he emerged from the womb, and the doctor thought he was stillborn. Thankfully, his immigrant grandmother grabbed the infant and doused him under a cold-water faucet, and baby Frank howled in protest.
    <br /><br />
    Thus, one of the greatest voices in history was first heard.
    <br /><br />
    He began crooning on street corners as a teenager, a surprisingly common occurrence in that time, and soon he caught on with an aspiring group called the Three Flashes. With Sinatra singing lead, they were re-christened the Hoboken Four and began to get noticed.
    <br /><br />
    In 1935 the quartet appeared on Major Bowes Amateur Hour, a popular radio program and the American Idol of its day. They won first prize, and spent the next few months on a national tour.
    <br /><br />
    After returning home, Sinatra got a gig at a popular supper club in Englewood Cliffs called the Rustic Cabin. For the princely sum of $15 a week he waited tables, told jokes as the resident MC and sang with the house combo.
    <br /><br />
    This was the Big Band Era, and one night in 1939 Harry James, leader of a popular group, caught Frank�s act. Just like that he took his next step up the ladder, with a raise to $75 a week.
    <br /><br />
    This turned out to be his key break, because in less than a year he signed with Tommy Dorsey�s band, even more renowned than trumpeter James� troupe, and his weekly check nearly doubled. He was truly launched, and soon he married his childhood sweetheart, bought a house in Hasbrouck Heights, and started a family. Amazingly, the modest Bergen County home still stands!
    <br /><br />
    The 1940s were very good to the singer as he began to crank out hit recordings and pack theatres. Even though he was painfully thin and his ears stuck out, he became a sex symbol to a whole generation of women known as Bobby Soxers. They turned out in droves and screamed as loudly as later generations would for Elvis and the Beatles.
    <br /><br />
    His Hollywood career began at the same time, and in 1943 he landed his first featured role in Reveille with Beverly, playing opposite legendary dancer Ann Miller. He continued to appear in fluffy musicals, but after signing with MGM he was promoted to A-list pictures like Anchors Aweigh, teaming with Gene Kelly. It was in this film that Sinatra proved he could hold his own with any top hoofer, matching Kelly step for step.
    <br /><br />
    There aren�t many who have mastered singing and dancing at that level, and he�s near the peak of that short list.
    <br /><br />
    Later on, he proved he had major acting chops too, playing straight dramatic parts and winning an Oscar for From Here to Eternity in 1953.
    <br /><br />
    My own favorites include The Joker is Wild, in which he plays real-life comedian Joe E. Lewis, who had his throat slashed by gangsters, and a forgotten Spencer Tracy adventure entitled The Devil at 4 O�Clock. Both pics, and his performance in each, still pack a wallop; check �em out.
    <br /><br />
    Sinatra also starred on Television, in night clubs and in arena concerts, and was still selling records and tickets nearly up to his dying day in 1998. A true triple threat, he may have been the most complete entertainer who ever lived.
    <br /><br />
    And as many stars as we�ve produced here, none come close to his impact or his enduring legacy.
