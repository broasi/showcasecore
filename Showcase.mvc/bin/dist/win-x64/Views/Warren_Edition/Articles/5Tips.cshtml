    After a relatively mild winter, it is hard to believe college finals are just a few weeks away. More than ever college students are experiencing an inability to cope with rising stress. Anxiety is palpable on college campuses. Students are facing increased pressures to achieve excellence in all aspects of their lives.     <br /><br />

    Most young people attend college with the primary goal of obtaining a higher education, however academics account for only a fraction of the overall experience. In the years following high school intellectual curiosities are satisfied and huge strides in personal growth are made.
    <br /><br />
    Lifelong friendships are developed during late night study sessions, while performing community service, and in the cafeteria between classes. College is for falling in love; with people, with places, with philosophies, and with life.
    <br /><br />
    By navigating relationships with people from diverse backgrounds and participating in activities outside of class, college students can learn how to cope with stress as well as the nuances of interpersonal relationships with both peers and professors. The lessons parents instill in children regarding honesty, respect, perseverance and courage are put into practice as young adults claim their independence.
    <br /><br />
    Young people lack the experience and perspective, which can only come with time. Lessons are often found in mistakes. Growth comes through risking, failing, and moving forward. Fail gloriously!
    <br /><br />
    There is a deep seeded fear of falling behind and not measuring up among today�s college students. During profoundly stressful exam weeks, it is important for students to remember no matter what they are experiencing, ultimately everything will work out. They will come out fine on the other side. As a psychiatrist to hundreds of young people as well as a mother of college students myself, I have prepared a series of tips designed to reduce exam anxiety.
    <br /><br />
    TOP 5 CRUCIAL TIPS TO REDUCE COLLEGE EXAM WEEK STRESS:
    <br /><br />
    1.	Develop a strategy or battle plan for exam week. Determine exactly what needs to be done and draft a schedule. Prioritize your list then tackle the most important items first. Be sure to allow for flexibility and avoid being too rigid. Alternate between reading, writing, working in small groups to maximize learning and retention.
    <br /><br />
    2.	Avoid emotionally draining people. Do not allow friends or family members to dump added stress on you. Anxiety is contagious. While everyone likes to feel helpful, during challenging times it is crucial to direct your energy towards your own goals and projects.
    <br /><br />
    3.	Do not be your own worst enemy. Pay attention to destructive self-talk. Negativity is often a self-fulfilling prophecy. Subconsciously, people give themselves an excuse for failure by adopting a pessimistic attitude. Do your best and remain positive.
    <br /><br />
    4.	Take care of yourself. Nothing is more important than your health, now and at any stage of your life. Eat proper meals, stay hydrated, and avoid sugar and excess caffeine. A short time out for an activity you enjoy will revitalize you. Take a quick walk or go on an outdoor run. The small study break will give your brain a breather and instantly elevate your mood.
    <br /><br />
    5.	Maintain a broader perspective. Exams and grades are important and you should always try your hardest, but remember college is about so much more than an education. Reframe your thinking to focus on the big picture as well as your long-term goals. Test scores and specific grades will matter very little years from now. What will matter is the way you coped with situations, the lessons you learned, and the education you gained.
    <br /><br />
    Best of luck with exams!
