                Letter from the Mayor's Office
            </div><br /><p></p><br /><br /><br />
            <p>To Warren Township residents and business community,</p>
            <p>The Township has a great Summer Program for our residents. It includes the following:</p>
            <p>The Recreation Commission will be presenting five concerts throughout the summer. All concerts are being held from 7:00-9:00pm on Wednesday nights with a rain date of Thursday night. Come out and enjoy different styles of music such as hit from the 50&rsquo;s to 80&rsquo;s, New Orleans Soul Funk, and more! Don&rsquo;t forget to bring your lawn chair.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>June 20- Bob Marino &amp; Barbra Lawson (Municipal Courtyard)</li>
                <li>June 27- Fabulous 50&rsquo;s Night Featuring the Keynotes (Municipal Courtyard)</li>
                <li>July 11- Little Jimmy &amp; The Starlites (Municipal Pavilion)</li>
                <li>July 25- Ross Griswold &amp; The Second Line (Municipal Pavilion)</li>
                <li>August 22- The JerZgirls (Municipal Courtyard)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We are also holding Warren&rsquo;s Got Talent on July 18 (Municipal Pavilion) and the Teen Fest on August 2 (held at Round Top- Rain date August 7, from 6:00-9:00 pm, admission is charged for participants).&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Over the last few months the Township Committee has been working very hard on our town's budget. As most of you know, the town expenses are a minor part of your property tax bill. The schools and the county make up the bulk of the expenses.</p>
            <p>Although our town expense impact is only about 20% of your property tax, I assure you that we are doing our very best to keep spending under control. We know that all of you are wrestling with your personal budgets and business expenses; and we are doing the same regarding municipal services. If you have been watching the cable broadcasts of our meetings, each budget item, by department, has been scrutinized and prioritized.</p>
            <p>Our goal was to keep spending flat. This was difficult as we did not receive any increase in support from the State of New Jersey, the winter storms required a massive increase in snow removal and debris cleanup, and many of our expenses such as insurance have gone up significantly.</p>
            <p>Several residents have offered advice and support. Their ideas are appreciated and certainly considered in the budgeting process.</p>
            <p>Our volunteers have saved us from significant expenses that would've hit our property taxes over the years. This is especially true for emergency services. We could see as much as a 10% increase in the cost of operating the Township if we had to pay for firefighters and rescue workers.</p>
            <p>The State&rsquo;s potential cuts in support might be significant for Warren Township in the coming years as we are rated one of towns with high wealth residents and a low tax rate. While we appreciate being recognized for our fiscal responsibility in keeping the tax rate low, I believe that we should have been rewarded and not penalized.</p>
            <p>The Township Committee thanks all of you for your support.</p>
            <p>Please remember to shop and do business locally. It keeps our Town strong and vibrant.</p>
            <br>
            Regards,<br><br>
            Mayor Victor Sordillo<br>
            Deputy Mayor Gary DiNardo<br>
            Carolann Garafola<br>
