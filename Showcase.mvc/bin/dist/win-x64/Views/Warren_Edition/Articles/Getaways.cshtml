            <p>Long vacations where you get to rest and unwind are amazing, however you don&rsquo;t always need a two-week vacation to return to work on Monday feeling rejuvenated.&nbsp; Short trips almost have the same effect as power naps: a quick repose can leave you feeling even more energized.&nbsp; Pair a quick getaway with little travel time and you&rsquo;ll be relaxing fast.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>When you&rsquo;re needing that getaway, consider heading down to Maryland&rsquo;s Eastern Shore and spending a few days in St. Michaels, a quiet town on the Chesapeake that many are dubbing &ldquo;the new Hamptons.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here are the top six things to do on your weekend getaway:</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum</li>
            </ol>
            <p>With its storied past, the Chesapeake Bay holds many secrets and the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum reveals them to you.&nbsp; Taking you through the age of the steamboat all the way to modern times, there is much to learn.&nbsp; The 35 buildings (ten of which are accessible by the public) are built on what was once docks and seafood packing houses, giving a truly historic feel.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <ol start="2">
                <li>Blue Crabs at Crab Claw</li>
            </ol>
            <p>If you didn&rsquo;t have blue crabs on your trip did you even go to Maryland?&nbsp; Visit this landmark for some of the best crabs around and roll up your sleeves and prepare to get dirty!</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <ol start="3">
                <li>Sailboat Cruise on the Chesapeake</li>
            </ol>
            <table align="right">
                <tr>
                    <td width="200" align="right"><img src="~/images/articles/getaways1.jpg" alt=""></td>
                </tr>
            </table>     
            <p>One of the biggest features and attractions of the whole area is no doubt the water.&nbsp;&nbsp; There truly is no better way to see St. Michaels than from the Chesapeake.&nbsp; Opt for a quick ride or a sunset sail, the choice is yours.&nbsp; Bonus: depending on your cruise, you may even get to catch a glimpse of the Inn at Perry Cabin, the location for some of the filming of <em>Wedding Crashers</em>!</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <ol start="4">
                <li>Eastern Shore Brewing Company</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Vacations don&rsquo;t always have to be go go go.&nbsp; Kick back at the Eastern Shore Brewing Company with some beers that are crafted from some of the finest ingredients by local craftsmen.&nbsp; If you brought your pup along for the weekend, he/she is more than welcome to join in on the fun.&nbsp; Stop by for live music and bring out the pints and water bowls!</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <ol start="5">
                <li>Michaels Bike Tour</li>
            </ol>
            <p>After all that beer, you&rsquo;re going to need to get out and do something active.&nbsp; Stop by the local bike shop to pick up some wheels and a map.&nbsp; Choose to head out with a plan or just bike the peninsula taking in all the beautiful water views.&nbsp; TriCycle &amp; Run (tricycleandrun.com) will deliver bikes directly to you, making this excursion even easier no matter where you are staying.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <ol start="6">
                <li>Sunset and an Orange Crush at Foxy&rsquo;s Harbor Grille</li>
            </ol>
            <p>End your trip with some of the best views and drinks in town!&nbsp; Located on the Miles River, Foxy&rsquo;s Harbor Grille is an easy stop for boaters and land lovers alike.&nbsp; Pull up dockside or landside and grab a Foxy&rsquo;s Crush which is made of vodka, fresh-squeezed juices, and topped with Sprite.&nbsp; Just add the sunset and you just might feel like you&rsquo;re in the Caribbean.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The beauty of living in New Jersey is that we have many states nearby that offer up many different things.&nbsp; Take advantage of this the next time you&rsquo;re looking for a quick jaunt away from your daily grind.&nbsp; North, south, east, or west, you just might be surprised.</p>
