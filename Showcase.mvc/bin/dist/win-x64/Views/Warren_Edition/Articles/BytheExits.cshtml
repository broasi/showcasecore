    <p><em>There&rsquo;s no shortage of historic, entertaining, or just plain interesting sites up and down the Jersey Shore.&nbsp; But after years of going &ldquo;By the Exits&rdquo; here up and down the Garden State Parkway, in 2018 we&rsquo;re trying something different: the New Jersey Turnpike!</em></p>
    <p><em>Sure, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re from Jersey? What exit?&rdquo; gets old after a while.&nbsp; But when you&rsquo;re thinking about how to tackle all there is to see and do in our great state, it&rsquo;s not the worst way to break things down.&nbsp; Taking the Turnpike bends you west into some of New Jersey&rsquo;s best agricultural regions (including some outstanding wine countries) and most interesting historical areas.&nbsp; The exits, of course, are more widely dispersed than those on the Parkway &ndash; giving you roughly one county per exit to explore.&nbsp; So far this year we&rsquo;ve moved through Salem, Cumberland, and Gloucester; in this issue, we&rsquo;ll explore Camden County. </em></p>
    <p><strong>Exit 3, Camden County.&nbsp; </strong></p>
    <p><strong>Camden.&nbsp; </strong>Adventure Aquarium is the city&rsquo;s big draw for families, and with good reason.&nbsp; In addition to being a first-class facility with a breathtaking array of aquatic life (don&rsquo;t miss the hippos!) a short walk out back brings you onto a promenade on the shore of the Delaware River.&nbsp; Directly across is the Philadelphia skyline, and not far down the river is the historic U.S.S. New Jersey.&nbsp; In the opposite direction, a few blocks north you&rsquo;ll find a spot where Cooper Street dead-ends at the water: it is believed that a ferry operating here beginning in the 1680s was the first official ferry business in what would become the United States.&nbsp; Linking the area with the young land&rsquo;s major port, Philadelphia, the ferry industry was responsible for the rise of Camden.</p>
    <p>A bit inland from the Delaware, on Martin Luther King Blvd. (which you&rsquo;ll likely take to reach the aquarium from the Turnpike) stands the Walt Whitman House.&nbsp; Whitman died here in 1892, after a stroke left him severely weakened in 1873 and he moved to Camden to be closer to his family.&nbsp; About two miles away, you can visit Whitman&rsquo;s tomb at Harleigh Cemetery, which neighbors the Camden Historical Society headquarters.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Cherry Hill.&nbsp; </strong>The city of Cherry Hill featured prominently in the films &ldquo;12 Monkeys&rdquo; and &ldquo;Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle&rdquo; &ndash; but I digress.&nbsp; Originally a Lenni Lenape settlement, the city takes its name from a 19<sup>th</sup> century farm that&rsquo;s now the site of the AMC Loews on Route 38.&nbsp; For a taste of Cherry Hill history, take a tour of the Barclay Farmhouse and keep an eye on their schedule for special living history programs throughout the year.&nbsp; The Farmhouse is listed on the National Register of Historic places.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Haddon Township/Haddonfield.&nbsp; </strong>Haddon Township&rsquo;s Ritz Theater marked its 90<sup>th</sup> anniversary last year, and along with Barclay Farmhouse represents Camden County on the National Register.&nbsp; It opened the same year Irving Berlin wrote &ldquo;Puttin&rsquo; On the Ritz.&rdquo;&nbsp; Berlin&rsquo;s song is said to have been inspired by London&rsquo;s Ritz Hotel, but you never know!</p>
    <p>(Actually, we do know &ndash; the Theatre opened in September 1927, while Berlin&rsquo;s song was written in May.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s fun to imagine.)</p>
    <p>Decades earlier, in 1858, neighboring Haddonfield was the site of an incredible archaeological find when the full skeleton of what became known as Hadrosaurus was uncovered.&nbsp; &ldquo;The official dinosaur of New Jersey,&rdquo; the discovery site is now a park and historic site at the end of Maple Avenue, near the Cooper River.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s also interesting, and maybe a little disappointing, to note that the name &ldquo;Hadrosaurus&rdquo; has nothing to do with Haddonfield &ndash; it comes from the Greek word &ldquo;hadros,&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;bulky.&rdquo;&nbsp; So New Jersey&rsquo;s official dinosaur is the &ldquo;bulky lizard&rdquo; &hellip; in case you were wondering!</p>
