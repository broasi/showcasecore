    <p>As the school year draws to a close and a bright summer of homework-free weekends, relaxing beach outings, and exotic summer travel plans approaches, students at Watchung Hills are eagerly looking forward to two exciting months of Summer Break.</p>
    <p>After two long weeks of Advanced Placement testing in May, many students enrolled in AP classes have already felt a massive relief from the intensive studying to prepare for the national exams. On the other hand, underclassmen have just begun the arduous process of preparing for finals, but do so willingly, knowing that once they overcome the final hurdle of finals they will be free from school-related stress until September. Seniors are feeling bittersweet as they count down their final days left at Watchung Hills before they graduate and move on to greater pursuits. Nonetheless, within the walls of Watchung Hills, students of all grade levels have been busy with an eventful conclusion to this school year.</p>
    <p>On May 17<sup>th</sup>, the All School Council hosted the Powder Puff Football Tournament to fundraise for the charity of the year, National Alliance for Mental Health (NAMI). Each team in the tournament consisted of twelve female players with male coaches and cheerleaders. The outdoor tournament took advantage of the warmer weather and was filled with team spirit.</p>
    <p>The Watchung Hills Performing Arts Center has had an especially packed schedule with end of year performances from each division of the Arts Department. From May 30 to June 1, the school hosted its annual Spring Arts Festival featuring dance, chorus, band, and theatre performances as well as film and visual arts showcases. Student artwork was very well received by those who attended, and Watchung Hills&rsquo; artists were proud to display their accomplishments from this school year. </p>
    <p>To celebrate Memorial Day, the members of the Watchung Hills Marching Band participated in both the Warren and the Long Hill Memorial Day Parades. As they marched through the towns, they spread spirit for the national holiday and gave back to the community celebration.</p>
    <p>On May 22<sup>nd</sup>, the All School Council hosted their second blood drive of the year, during which students could be excused from certain classes to donate blood to Morristown Memorial Hospital. Students had to be at least 16 years old and minors required parental consent to donate.</p>
    <p>At the end of May, the Junior Statesmen of America (JSA) Club hosted a Dodgeball Tournament to fundraise for the THON charity, which provides support for children and families impacted by childhood cancer. The club, which meets weekly to debate relevant current event topics, has been fundraising for THON throughout this year. The tournament attracted students of all grade levels and was a widely successful event to close out the year.</p>
    <p>On June 7<sup>th</sup>, the senior class of 2018 will make memories with one of their final celebrations: Senior Prom. This year the Senior Grade Level Council (GLC) chose the Hyatt Regency as the venue for a wonderful night of music, food, dancing, and of course, many, many pictures. Many seniors plan to embrace the warm weather and spend the weekend following the prom at the beach with their peers, as a preview to what the summer will hold.</p>
    <p>The following Monday, students and teachers will put on the 3<sup>rd</sup> Annual Dancing with the Teachers fundraiser. After several weeks of collaborative rehearsals, sports teams, clubs, dancers, and teachers will join together to compete for various awards from &ldquo;Most Committed&rdquo; to &ldquo;Most Awkward.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Finally, to officially close out the year, the Watchung Hills Class of 2018 will graduate on June 22. Graduation will be a celebration of the Seniors&rsquo; time as Warriors, with underclassmen, friends, family, and teachers cheering them on and showing their support just as they have over the past four years. And although it will be sad for the Class of 2018 to leave Watchung Hills, they will enter a new chapter of their lives grateful for what they have learned here, making room for a new class to embark on their Warrior experience.</p>
