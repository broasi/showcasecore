</div> 
<br>

<br><br><br /><br />  
    <p>It can be hard to stay up on every trend and find the best styles for your body type. Luckily, the fashion world has taken notice and there are now monthly or quarterly subscription boxes sent straight to your door with styles customized just for you. Whether it&rsquo;s everyday casual gear, office wear, or athletic apparel, there is a box for you!&nbsp; There are a lot of options out there, so how do you choose which ones to invest in? Up your fashion game in 2018 with one of these top fashion subscription boxes.</p>
    <p>1.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.stitchfix.com" target="_blank">Stitch Fix</a></p>
    <p>Stitch Fix is a monthly personal styling subscription service that offers apparel, shoes, and accessories for women (including plus, petites, and maternity)! &nbsp;&nbsp;When you go to the website to sign up you take an in-depth survey, so your personal stylist can send you accurate sizes that reflect your style and pricing preferences. Choose when you&rsquo;d like to receive your delivery and your stylist will hand select 5 items based on your preferences. The styling fee is $20, but that includes free shipping and free returns. One of the perks to this box is if you keep any of the items they send you, you get to deduct the $20 fee from the total. And if you keep all the items, you get a 25% discount!</p>
    <p>2.&nbsp;<a href="http://LeTote.com" target="_blank">Le Tote</a></p>
    <p>Another monthly delivery service is Le Tote. You can choose a &ldquo;tote&rdquo; of three clothing pieces and two accessories from the company&rsquo;s inventory.&nbsp; Once your delivery comes, you can try the items on, wear them to work or when you&rsquo;re hanging out with friends, and once you&rsquo;re done, just ship the stuff you don&rsquo;t want back! You can also purchase the pieces you do want if you fall in love with a piece. One of the perks of this service is you get unlimited &ldquo;totes&rdquo; every month, so you don&rsquo;t have to wait to try out more stuff. This service is $49 a month.</p>
    <p>3.&nbsp;<a href="http://boxofstyle.thezoereport.com/" target="_blank">Box of Style by Rachel Zoe</a></p>
    <p>The Box of Style from The Zoe Report by Rachel Zoe is a quarterly subscription box. Each seasonal box includes a &ldquo;hero&rdquo; item which is revealed right before boxes ship by The Zoe Team. These boxes also have other curated fashionable items and accessories, plus a few beauty products and styling tools. This box is always packaged beautifully, which makes it perfect for gifting as well. This service is $100 a quarter for seasonal items.</p>
    <p>4.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rocksbox.com/" target="_blank">Rocksbox</a></p>
    <p>Jewelry lovers, listen up! Go to the website to create a profile where you can add items to your jewelry wish list. You&rsquo;ll get three hand-selected pieces in the mail based on your style profile you filled out. You can wear the pieces for as long as you like and send back when you don&rsquo;t want them anymore! The great thing with this box is you can get an unlimited number of boxes sent to you every month. The only restriction with the &ldquo;unlimited&rsquo; number of boxes is you can only borrow three pieces at a time, so you&rsquo;ll need to return a piece before you can request a new one. &nbsp;This is one of the least expensive boxes at only $19 a month.</p>
    <p>5.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.Fabletics.com" target="_blank">Fabletics</a></p>
    <p>If you don&rsquo;t work a normal 9-5 or don&rsquo;t need more casual clothes, invest in some feel-good workout gear that will motivate you to work out!&nbsp; With Fabletics, which strictly offers athleisure gear, new customers first go to their website to take a lifestyle quiz.&nbsp; Fabletics then recommends workout clothing for you to purchase. If you buy the VIP subscription, you&rsquo;ll choose a complete workout outfit, a top and a bottom, to be shipped to your house. If you don&rsquo;t like any of the choices offered, you can always opt to &ldquo;Skip the Month,&rdquo; so you won&rsquo;t be charged. Prices start at $49.95 for a monthly subscription.</p>
    <p>6.&nbsp;<a href="https://shop.gwynniebee.com/" target="_blank">Gwynnie Bee</a></p>
    <p>&nbsp;Gwynnie Bee is a plus size clothing rental subscription service for women sizes 10-32. They specialize in trendy tops, tees, jeans and dresses. Once you fill out the profile on their site, subscribers receive 1-3 items at a time to wear as much as they&rsquo;d like. Then you can either return those for new items or purchase them to add to your wardrobe!&nbsp; There are six different boxes that range from $49 to $199 per month.</p>
