    <p>(NAPS)&mdash;If your brakes are trying to tell you something, you should pay attention. A properly operating brake system helps ensure safe vehicle control and operation and it should be checked immediately if you suspect any problems.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;While an annual brake inspection is a good way to ensure brake safety, motorists should not ignore signs that their brakes need attention,&rdquo; said Rich White, executive director, Car Care Council. &ldquo;Knowing the key warning signs that your brakes may need maintenance will go a long way toward keeping you and others safe on the road.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>What To Watch Out For</p>
    <p>Motorists should look for the following warning signs that their brakes need to be inspected:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Noise:</strong> screeching, grinding or clicking noises when applying the brakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Pulling:</strong> vehicle pulls to one side while braking.</li>
        <li><strong>Low Pedal:</strong> brake pedal nearly touches the floor before engaging.</li>
        <li><strong>Hard Pedal: </strong>you must apply extreme pressure to the pedal before brakes engage.</li>
        <li><strong>Grabbing:</strong> brakes grab at the slightest touch to the pedal.</li>
        <li><strong>Vibration:</strong> brake pedal vibrates or pulses, even under normal braking conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Light: </strong>brake light is illuminated on your vehicle&rsquo;s dashboard.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Because brakes are a normal wear item on any vehicle, they will eventually need to be replaced. Factors that can affect brake wear include driving habits, operating conditions, vehicle type and the quality of the brake lining material. Be sure to avoid letting brakes get to the metal-to-metal point as that can mean expensive rotor or drum replacement.</p>
    <p>The Car Care Council offers a free custom service schedule and e-mail reminder service to help car owners remember to have their brakes inspected and take good care of their vehicles. It&rsquo;s an easy-to-use resource designed to help motorists drive smart, save money and make informed decisions.</p>
    <p>The Car Care Council is also the source of information for the &ldquo;Be Car Care Aware&rdquo; consumer education campaign promoting the benefits of regular vehicle care, maintenance and repair to consumers.</p>

    <p>Your brakes may be squealing on you. If so, it&rsquo;s safe to say, you should listen to them.</p>
