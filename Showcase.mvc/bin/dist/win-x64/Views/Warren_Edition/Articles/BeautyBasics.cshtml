    Lash Extensions: Tips You Need To Know Before Heading to the Salon

    <b>What are the most common types of lash extensions?</b>
    <br /><br />
    There are three types of lash extensions: synthetic, silk and mink. They also comes in different sizes. Once selected, the lashes are applied one at a time using a specially formulated, semi-permanent glue that will not irritate the eye nor damage the natural lash.

    <b>How long does it take to apply lash extensions?</b>
    <br /><br />
    Applying a full set of lashes takes about one to two hours, and can be maintained year-round with touch-ups recommended every two weeks.
    <br /><br />
    <b>What happens if glue gets in your eyes?</b>
    <br /><br />
    Since your eyes are closed the whole time lash extensions are being applied, no glue will ever get into your eyes. To avoid any irritation, however, the first safety precaution you can take is to be sure that the glue is safe for your eyes and doesn�t contain anything that can harm them, like formaldehyde.
    <br /><br />
    <b>What happens when you cry?</b>
    <br /><br />
    If you experience any burning or discomfort during the procedure, causing your eyes to tear or making you cry, this is a huge red flag and you should certainly speak up. You may need to have your technician change the glue. Getting lash extensions should be a completely pain-free experience.
    <br /><br />
    <b>What Type of lashes are better?</b>
    <br /><br />
    People want all different kinds of looks � some people go for drama, and some opt for something more natural. The benefits of mink lash extensions are that they are more feathery looking and lighter in general, so they put less pressure on your lashes. Mink lashes also come at a higher cost.
    <br /><br />
    <b>Do lash extensions fall out over a certain period of time?</b>
    <br /><br />
    Since each lash extension is attached to a single eyelash, they will fall out naturally along with the natural growth cycle of each lash. We recommend a touch-up every two weeks.
    When an inexperienced professional applies lashes, he or she often applies one synthetic lash to three to four natural lashes, causing clumps or the lash to break and fall out.
    <br /><br />
    <b>Can you shower or swim right away? Are there products you should absolutely avoid?</b>
    <br /><br />
    Keep water away from your lashes for the first 12 to 24 hours after application or touch-ups. Water can weaken the adhesive before it is set and cause lashes to fall off. The after-care varies depending on the glue used. For instance, with glue for sensitive eyes, oil-based products or makeup removers around the eye area are not recommended. Using water-proof mascara on the extensions is not recommended for any type of glue, as it is hard to remove and can actually pull off the lashes prematurely when trying to take it off.
    <br /><br />
    <b>Is it okay to also wear mascara?</b>
    <br /><br />
    If you are planning to wear mascara in addition to the extensions, only use it on the tips of the extensions and with a very light hand.
    <br /><br />
    <b>Will your natural lashes get harmed or damaged?</b>
    <br /><br />
    The biggest myth is that lash extensions ruin your own lashes. They do not. If applied correctly and properly, they are safe and do not ruin the health of your natural lashes. Be sure not to rub your eyes or tug or pull on the extensions because this can cause lash loss and even damage to your natural lashes. If lashes are applied properly and to each individual lash, they won�t fall out.
