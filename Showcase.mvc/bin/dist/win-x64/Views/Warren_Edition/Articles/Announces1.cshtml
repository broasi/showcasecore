    There are people in the world Security & Investigative Services who seem to demonstrate excellence
    in all they do and then they repeat
    it over and over again. Aristotle said,
   <b> �Excellence is an art won by training
    and habituation. We do not act
    rightly because we have virtue or excellence,
    but we rather have those because we
    have acted rightly. We are what we repeatedly
    do. Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit.�</b>
    A fine example of Aristotle�s habit of excellence
    is Warren Middle School�s graduating eighth
    grader, Aneesh Karuppur. 0is young man is
    a person of action, a self-starter and more importantly,
    a self-finisher. Among the many students
    at Warren Middle School, Aneesh, too,
    takes full advantage of the learning opportunities
    that have been offered to him for the
    past three years and has attained the highest
    level of achievement in most. Aneesh is an accomplished
    young man who enjoys the thrill
    of a challenge and handles success with humility
    and defeat with grace. He is a risk taker
    who can start with an idea and bring it to
    fruition while keeping a smile on his face and
    a spring in his step. Aneesh has demonstrated
    excellence through his many accomplishments
    and is revered by his peers
    and his teachers as an exceptional
    student. Excellence does not always
    come easy and with perseverance and
    drive, Aneesh takes on challenges
    knowing that he could be faced with
    defeat. However, defeat never stops this young
    man from forging ahead. Aneesh yearns for a
    deeper understanding as to why he succeeds
    and why he fails and has an impressive way of
    implementing self-improvement to grow from
    each experience. To know Aneesh is to be delighted
    by his playful personality, influenced
    by his budding leadership and inspired by his
    never-ending energy. He is a positive person
    who has made his mark on Warren Middle    
    School in distinctive ways including outstanding
    performance in quiz tournaments, geography
    bees, history bees, math contests, robotics
    and music, to name a few. Aneesh encompasses
    the true definition of excellence and
    more so serves as the finest example of acting
    rightly. Congratulations to Aneesh Karuppur,
    the recipient of the 2017 Showcase Award of
    Excellence!
