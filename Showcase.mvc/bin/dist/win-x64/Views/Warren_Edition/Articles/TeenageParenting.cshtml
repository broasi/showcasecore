    Often times I refer to teenagedom as teenagedoom, as these years are tough not only for teens but also for their parents. From the perspective of the teen, parents just don�t �get it�, they are just clueless and so, so, so annoying. From the perspective of the parent, the teens are ungrateful, outright disrespectful, and out of control. No one knows how to push your buttons better and no one can bring out the worst in you better than your teenager can.
    <br /><br />
    I too have been there and done that. If you could have been a fly on the wall at times in my home when my daughters were teens, I would be terribly embarrassed. I am not sure sometimes how we all survived those years. Fortunately, as the years have passed, I have developed a very special relationship with each of them. From my years of experience as a mom of three daughters (who are currently in their early 20�s) and through my years of experience as a practicing Child & Adolescent Psychiatrist, I have some helpful tips to share.

    Three Essential Tips on Parenting Your Obnoxious Teenager
    <br /><br />
    1. Have empathy. It is not easy to walk in the shoes of teenagers today. They experience a tremendous amount of pressure from peers and authority figures as they try to figure out who they are and what they may want to do with their lives. Their bodies are changing and their hormones are raging causing insecurities to heighten and moods to swing. Furthermore, adolescents put themselves and their lives under a microscope so even the most minor issue will seem catastrophic. Having empathy for your teen will help them through their issues, but also will allow you to not get so worked up about their reactions and behavior.
    <br /><br />
    2. Do not overreact. Yelling, eye rolling, being ignored, and nasty behavior by your teen, will understandably cause you as a parent to feel hurt and angry. After all you have done for your child, you don�t deserve the way you are being treated. Your anger will bring out the worst in you as your teen drags you into defending yourself or your rules.  The next thing you know is that the conversation between you and your teen is going south pretty fast. Your role is to deal with your teen�s behavior as objectively as possible without stooping to their level and overreacting. Don�t take your teen�s behavior personally as it is not about you necessarily, but about the level of frustration and stress they feel. Decide which behavior you�re going to focus on and which you can ignore and let go.
    <br /><br />
    3. Let go of your anger and continue to parent. Your teen will make you feel depressed, guilty, and crazy with anger as he/she continues to be rebellious and rude. Your pent up anger and frustration is normal. Find ways to channel your emotion so that you can continue to be effective as a parent. Let your teen know that you are having a hard time communicating with them in the moment. Walk away from your teen and allow yourself to step back and for things to cool down. Remember that it is not always worth over communicating and processing all the minutia of details of any argument as it may be counter productive. Just moving on and letting go may yield a better outcome. Also, sometimes peace is more important than being right. Recognize that underneath all that anger and frustration you experience, you still love your teen and want what is best for him/her and your child still loves and needs you!
