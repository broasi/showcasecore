    What�s in a name? When it comes to the yam, a bit of confusion. The truth is what you�ve been calling a yam is most likely a sweet potato. Even more, it�s possible that you�ve never even tasted a yam!
    <br /><br />
    Before you reach for the candied yams this Thanksgiving, there's something you need to know. They're not actually yams! All this time, many Americans have been making the mistake of calling sweet potatoes "yams." But there's actually a difference. It turns out sweet potatoes and yams are not even related. They are two different species of root vegetable with very different backgrounds and uses.
    <br /><br />
    Do you know the difference between a yam and a sweet potato? Most grocery stores, and farmers markets offer two similar-looking tubers � some labeled as yams, and some as sweet potatoes.
    <br /><br />
    Would you be surprised if I told you that all those times you thought you were eating yams, you were likely eating a sweet potato, and that you probably haven't ever actually had a true yam? And yet yam and sweet potato do mean different things in grocery stores, and farmers markets.
    <br /><br />
    While much of the confusion stems from these names being used interchangeably in U.S. markets and in recipes, sweet potatoes and yams are actually two distinct and very different vegetables.
    <br /><br />
    That sweet, orange-colored root vegetable that you love so dearly is actually a sweet potato. Yes, all so-called �yams� are in fact sweet potatoes. Most people think that long, red-skinned sweet potatoes are yams, but they really are just one of many varieties of sweet potatoes. So where did all of the confusion come from? Let�s break down the main differences between yams and sweet potatoes!
    <br /><br />
    Yam vs. Sweet Potato: A true yam is a starchy edible root of the Dioscorea genus, and is generally imported to America from the Caribbean. It is rough and scaly and very low in beta carotene.
    <br /><br />
    Depending on the variety, sweet potato flesh can vary from white to orange and even purple. The orange-fleshed variety was introduced to the United States several decades ago. In order to distinguish it from the white variety everyone was accustomed to, producers and shippers chose the English form of the African word �nyami� and labeled them �yams.�
    <br /><br />
    Sweet potatoes (Ipomoea batatas) come in two main varieties here in the States. One has a golden skin with creamy white flesh and a crumbly texture. The other has a copper skin with an orange flesh that is sweet and soft. All sweet potato varieties generally have the same shape and size -- they are tapered at the ends and much smaller than the aforementioned yams.
    <br /><br />
    Americans have been calling the orange-fleshed variety of sweet potatoes "yams" since colonial times when Africans saw familiarities in them to the tuberous variety. The USDA decided to label them as "yams" to differentiate the two varieties. Both varieties of sweet potato, including "yams" can be widely found in supermarket.
    <br /><br />
    Yams (family Dioscoreaceae) are native to Africa and Asia and other tropical regions. Yams are starchy tubers that have an almost black bark-like skin and white, purple or reddish flesh and come in many varieties. The tubers can be as small as regular potatoes or grow upwards of five feet long.
    <br /><br />
    The word yam comes from an African word, which means "to eat." The yam holds great importance as a foodstuff because it keeps for a long time in storage and is very valuable during the wet season, when food is scarce. For eating, yams are typically peeled, boiled and mashed or dried and ground into a powder that can be cooked into porridge. Yams can be found in international markets, such as those that specialize in Caribbean foods.
    <br /><br />
    Happy Holidays from our family to yours and enjoy those holiday trimmings� will you be eating yams or sweet potatoes?
