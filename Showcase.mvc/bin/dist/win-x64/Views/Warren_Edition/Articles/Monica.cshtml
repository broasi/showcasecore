    As we approach Easter, I dedicate this month’s column to “America’s Pastor”, the late beautiful Billy Graham. His Easter Message over fifty years ago is as relative today as it was then:
    <br /><br />
    “The clear majority of the people around the world are looking to politics, science and education for the solution to life’s problems, and not to Jesus Christ. Why is this? …
    <br /><br />
    It was the resurrection of Christ (Easter) that caused the disciples to go out as burning young revolutionaries to change the world of their day. They preached that Christ was alive…The risen Christ wants to come into our hearts today… When Christ was on earth, He would go to the temple, but He did not stay there. He went into the streets where the sick, the needy and the dying were. His love and compassion broke the bounds of class, race and creed…
    <br /><br />
    Yes, Jesus Christ is alive. This risen Christ, taken by faith in all His power and glory, is great enough and big enough to cope with every problem the human race faces at this hour.
    <br /><br />
    First, a risen Christ is big enough to cope with the tyranny of man over man. Not only can He save the individual, but His power also has worldwide implications. Isaiah 9:6 says, “The government will be upon His shoulder.” He has not abdicated His sovereignty in the affairs of men. He is still the Lord of history… We think that the world’s problems could be solved by diplomacy, by scientific advancement, by economic progress. We have lost the New Testament concept that envisioned a cosmic Christ who was woven into the warp and woof of the universe and who could not be taken out without destroying the fabric of the whole world…
    <br /><br />
    Second, the resurrected Christ is also big enough to cope with the gigantic social problems of these times. The race problem is not limited to any one city, nor to any one part of the United States. The race problem is a worldwide problem. Wherever two races or two nationalities or even two religious groups live together, there is friction and misunderstanding.
    It is into this kind of situation that Christ can come with the healing “balm of Gilead.”
    We must recognize the relationship between Christianity and healthy social conditions… I believe that a great spiritual revival today would have social consequences throughout the world. Christ has an answer to the social problems. He can meet them in His resurrection power and glory.
    <br /><br />
    But let us not forget that man does not in himself have the capacity to love his neighbor. He does not have the capacity to live according to Christian ethics until he has come to Jesus Christ. When you repent of your sins and receive Christ as Savior, He enlarges your capacity and gives you new ability to love your neighbor. When you come to know Him, He gives you new powers, new directions, new strengths, new visions, new dimensions of living… Christ can indeed cope with the social and political problems of the world.
    <br /><br />
    The world today offers many shortcuts to salvation, but to be truly saved we must be reconciled to God… Give your life to Jesus Christ today. Receive Him as your Lord and Savior. And whatever personal problems you may have, and whatever great problems may face the world, you can find help, and you can make your contribution to this generation by making your commitment and your decision for Jesus Christ. Let His joy, His peace, His love, dominate your life.” ~ Reverend Billy Graham, Easter Message 1964
    <br /><br />
    This year, an Easter Message will be presented by Pastor Raphael Giglio on the shores of Ocean Grove Beach at sunrise. Everyone is invited to join North Shore Fellowship on the beach near the covered pavilion at 6:30 Easter Sunday morning for the first Easter Service of this new congregation! You will hear a message of hope and redemption, while you witness the glorious sunrise over the ocean and contemplate its metaphorical connection to the meaning of Easter!
    <br /><br />
    Happy Easter, Happy Passover, Happy Mother’s Day to everyone!
