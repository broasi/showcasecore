Carol Benner, this month's Warren Showcase cover artist has been involved with various art media for most of her life.  Sunflowers & Zinnias which graces the front cover of The Warren Showcase is one of many in her flower series.
<br><br>
After having minored in Art at Bethany College, her interest in oil painting surfaced a few years ago under the instruction of Flemington artist, James Hankard, followed by additional study under Trish Vergis, an artist from Frenchtown.  
<br><br>
Painting with oils from real life and photos, she particularly enjoys creating still life's and landscapes.  Her work has been featured in several art shows - The Frame Carriage in Frenchtown, NJ, and Carpedium Art Gallery in Califon, NJ.  She has also exhibited in the A.C.E. 2007 Juried Show in Bethlehem, PA, The Highlands Art Gallery in Chester, NJ, Connexions Gallery in Easton, PA, The State Theatre in Easton, PA, and the Tinicum Art Festival in Tinicum, PA.  
<br><br>
Having lived in Hunterdon County, NJ, for more than 25 years, Carol recently moved to Easton, PA, with her husband, Bill.  For more information please email her at carol@rudl.com.  Her website is <a href="http://www.carolbennerpaintings.net" target="_blank">www.carolbennerpaintings.com</a>.
