This month's Warren Showcase cover, "Beach Buddies" is the artistic creation of Scott Griswold Jr. 
Scott Griswold Jr. attended Indiana University of Pennsylvania as a music major in classical piano performance. While there he picked up a camera and never put it down. In 1980 Scott was invited to exhibit with Ansel Adams, Edward Weston and Jerry Uelsmann, an exhibit attended by over three thousand art enthusiasts. Soon after, Scott was noticed by Kodak executives at this early stage in his career. The imaging giant selected Griswold from an international talent pool to create the single fine-art image to launch their newest film, TMAX. worldwide and to act as a consultant to the Professional Division of Eastman Kodak Company. At that time, even limited reproduction rights to Griswold's images commanded tens of thousands of dollars. Scott Griswold's work has been exhibited worldwide including venues in New York, Los Angeles, London, Cologne, Sidney and Paris.
<br><br>
Always seeking new ways to interpret his unique view of the world, Scott Griswold developed a new technique he calls Digital Painting. Using digital tools, he painstakingly re-constructs his original images to create an exciting, vibrant and new work of art which is reproduced on canvas with the Giclee process. He actually mixes color and draws using digital tools!
<br><br>
"The advantage to this exciting and new process is that any image can be made in five sizes up to 36x48 inches on stretched canvas," says Scott. "The home or business owner can come to me, select the image, color scheme and now size-appropriate framed-canvas for their interior design requirements."

You can enjoy Scott Griswold's artwork online at www.ScottGriswoldArt.com or see it in person in Cape May, NJ at his gallery, Cape May on Canvas, 412 Washington Street - 609-884-8716.
